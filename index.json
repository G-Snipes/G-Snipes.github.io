[{"content":"Welcome to the first ever log in what will hopefully be a series of “show recaps”. Where I recap my thoughts about the acts I see performing live music both large and underground.\nI wish I started this sooner as I’ve seen many shows in my day. From dark humid basements, all the way to Wells Fargo Stadium, I’ve seen countless shows. I absolutely do not want to know how much I’ve spent on concert tickets in the last five years of my adolescence. Don’t worry though, I’m financially stable (for the most part) and I’m proud to be a concert junkie. I’m just glad I can provide something like this to other people who might be interested. It’s the least I can do.\nPlease note that I am not a critic, I am recapping the shows and mentioning my personal background knowledge and experience with the bands and artists I see. I ain’t doing this for every show I go to. I’m just doing it for the shows I want to. Also, I believe as a rule of thumb that when it comes to this stuff that if you don’t have anything nice to say don’t say it at all.\nLast night on Friday 11/22/24 I saw a show at a Temple house show venue called Over Yonder. I think it has become the best house show venue in Philly, (at least in North), that gets as professional as one can be in this setting, with a good emphasis on sound control and making sure the neighbors are okay with it. The name of this venue is probably one of the most clever I’ve heard, and not to be a suck up, but I think this idea speaks to the ingenuity, and energy that is the Machine. The Machine is a promoter/community collective in Philly that books all kinds of shows, but I would say, and they’d probably agree, that they gravitate more to the rave, dj, and electronic scene. This show however, was a classic 4 band basement bill with an eclectic cast. Prior to this show I have been referring to this bill as the “homie show” hence why I’m eager to blog about it. I love all these bands and all my friends who play in them.\nSmall Head Big Torso Vicious Grip #Perhaps the most mysterious band on the bill to me, as friends of the Machine, I knew I was in for a treat. I’ve briefly spoken to the guitarist, Gio, as well as seen them around a lot. Particularly one time at an Unwound show in Jersey City. From my brief interactions, I’ve sensed the moral convictions within them that they strive to uphold, and they’re determination certainly poured out explosively into their performance and the music itself.\nWith one guitarist, one drummer, and two line-outs, I was so happy to see this band match the exact energy I imagined an act called “Small Head Big Torso Vicious Grip” would exude. And that is what punk music is about. Its losing one’s voice by the end of the set from screaming, having “FUCK” and “gentrification” stickers on their gear, dragging a rack tom into the audience for people to smack as they please, and sprinkling some Unwound in there indeed. If you see this band, do them a favor and bring your energy. Oh, and earplugs.\nIG\nWallace, Tonight! #The Philly House show scene would not feel the same to me without the presence of Wallace, Tonight!. Performing as a five piece at this show due to the fabulous return of their drummer Grace, they proved that they can, and will, rock your house down if you ask them. I’ve been blessed over the past couple years to be able to converse and hang out with all five of them at some point or another and I just wanted to mention that as far as people go they are all absolute lads. Plus they’re great musicians.\nTheir most recent release of their single “Wrinkler” tickles my brain so well, and may be my favorite so far in the Wallace discography. There is something special about hearing a live band perform countless times and then to have that music available at any time in your ears. I love live sets on the internet, but studios get the real job done.\nSonically speaking Wallace, Tonight is tight, energetic, and captivating. Will they hate me if I say they’re fun too? I have fun listening and watching them. I just do. I know I do because I have a big wide grin on my face the whole time. Since I’ve seen them so much, it might be time to admit that I’ve developed some nostalgia for their music as well. I find they’re music easy to listen to, and I mean that as a compliment. I feel that despite their wide array of grandiose landscapes and complex playing styles. Saying that they are “easy to listen to” doesn’t mean that they’re slow in the tempo department either. They can get a mosh going without even trying. “Keep Going” gets my heart pumping and my mind racing every time.\nWith the return of Grace, I’m excited to see what these guys cook up in the coming months. I love Wallace, Tonight!. Sue me.\n(Also shoutout their YouTube channel some of them run: Wallace, Watches You can check out all kinds of live sets there, as well as all the sets from tonight. Go listen to Wallace, Tonight! tonight!)\nIG\nAll the Flowers #There was a time when All the Flowers was not on my conscience. Like I guess everything is initially. That was until I was smacked in the face with their EP “Those You’ve Known and Loved”. Okay I might’ve lied, I think I knew a crumb of information, and that was that that one guy from RowTone, (who I now know as Ryan), played in this band. I now know more though. I now know that All the Flowers set a personal music record for me, and that is the fact that they made me cry.\nAm I getting too dramatic?\nBut no seriously… they’re music is beautiful, and it made me cry. Their particular shade of instrumentals, combined with the very honey and relatable lyrics, and well sung vocal harmonies led me straight to my feelings. Instrumentally, there are not too many bands in Philly, or bands in general I know of that have a violinist. They did. (I apologize if it\u0026rsquo;s actually a viola, my dumbass doesn’t know the difference.) And for me it applies as the perfect cherry on top of everything else they got going on.\nIf you like their music on streaming, they sound awesome live! They know how to put on a show. I love when all of them sing into the microphone at the same time. \u0026lt;3\nIG\nMormon Toasterhead #I first saw Mormon Toaster Head in a really hot and humid basement in South Philly two summers ago. What I left with was a minor state of shock as I couldn’t comprehend what their frontman and guitarist Benzo Von Vivant was doing, and how the hell it was working so well!? A lot of conceptions I had of how one should play guitar got thrown out the window. I hate the word “should”. Anyways, what I just said is a bit of an overstatement. I’m being dramatic. However if there was ever a local band that threw me for a loop because of their live performance, it would be Mormon Toaster Head.\nBennett Hammy, my good friend, yueblum legend, ex-Dimmer bassist, and certified cutie, has fruitfully been added to Mormon’s roster as a second guitarist. This is likely due to his insane aura. Not his talent and the friendly connection he formed with their drummer Charlie.\nThe tones, the vibe, everything sounded awesome. The sound levels in general were good throughout the whole night. Just ask the stupid grins on my and John from Wallace, Tonight’s face. They’ve been playing a lot of their new unreleased stuff which I like and which Bennett won’t leak to me no matter how much I ask him. I’ll give him a pass for playing well. Especially during the jam session they had at the end of their set, which might have ended up being my favorite part. Either that or them referencing Infinite Jest. Although after reading their bio on Spotify the reference lines up.\nListening to their music, I find it so refreshingly original, uplifting, and fantastic! My favorite song is “Butterfly Museum”. I hope they play it one day. Listen to their new album “Free Wheel”!\nIG\nGo listen to the livesets if you want here -\u0026gt; Link\nSee yah next time!\n","date":"23 November 2024","permalink":"/blog/2024/show-recap/","section":"Blog","summary":"Show recap for SHBTVG, Wallace, Tonight!, All the Flower, and Mormon Toasterhead @OverYonder","title":""},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/all-the-flowers/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"All the Flowers"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/live-music/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Live Music"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/mormon-toasterhead/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Mormon Toasterhead"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/music/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Music"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/over-yonder/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Over Yonder"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/small-head-big-torso-vicious-grip/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Small Head Big Torso Vicious Grip"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/the-machine/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"The Machine"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/wallace-tonight/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Wallace, Tonight!"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/annie-dirusso/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Annie DiRusso"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/buice/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Buice"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/cage-the-elephant/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Cage the Elephant"},{"content":"Here is something a little different than my usual blog posts. I saw a reddit thread where someone asked reddit what concerts exceeded their expectations and which concerts didn’t. I’m going to have two categories. One for those who exceeded my expectations, and one for those who didn’t meet them. I’m going to loosely order them from bigger to smaller acts.\nAlso as a disclaimer, I love and appreciate all the bands and artists listed below (except Young Thug). These are just my lame opinions. So without further ado here is my picks:\nExceeded My Expectations #Tame Impala #Tame Impala was the ultimate headliner as far as I’m concerned when I went to Firefly festival in September of 2021. Now, was I sober for Tame Impala while at a festival in the woods? That fact may have swayed my opinion here for sure, but alas Kevin grabbed my mind’s eye whether I liked it or not. Before I forget, I must say that their light show was 100% the best I’ve ever seen, and I would argue the best in the world. There was this giant floating circle ring that played above the band the entire time, and it fired lasers above the crowd that I assumed were blasting into outer space. I couldn’t believe that they were playing all the music live as I was totally convinced that they were lip syncing the music. That’s how spot on it sounded. I completely lost myself in their music, playing air guitar for “Let it Happen” and loving how I bonded with the strangers around me as we all sang the lyrics and danced together. Tame Impala is a must see before you die. I hope I get to see them again in a festival setting like that.\nGlass Animals #So these blokes actually played before Tame Impala at the same festival. Their music still means a lot to me and at the time I was very into them. How to Be a Human Being is still one of my favorite albums of all time. I think their style of making pop songs with their use of percussion is some of the best in the business. So yeah, I was very excited to see them live. I remember being squished way in front just to the right of the stage. It was a long night at that festival and it seemed like they would never come out, but then they did, in what felt like an explosion. Wavey Davey ripped through all of the songs like it was nothing and I can just feel how excited they all were to be there. He has quite the voice. I felt the whole crowd light up with anticipation for each song. And the cherry on top was that they brought out Denzel Curry to sing Tokyo Drifting with them. What more could I have wanted at that time in my life?\nCage the Elephant #Let me just say, Cage the Elephant are a group of absolute rockstars. They were also a headliner at Firefly festival and with the combination of their raw energy, Matt Shultz’s stage presence, and a crowd that knew their songs, they earned their spot as one of the bands that exceeded my expectations. They know exactly how to put on a rock show, and they executed on that more than perfectly, with a guitar smashing at the end of the show to boot.\nUnwound #My bandmate Mike always had a deep love for this band that took me a while to understand. If I can go back in time I would make sure Unwound was known about and praised to the level Nirvana, Soundgarden, and other Washington bands were at that time. At the time I saw them I liked a few of their songs, after all we covered “Envelope”, but when I saw them in Philly a little while ago I got way more than I ever expected. These guys did not let their age show at all, and knew exactly how to channel the seasoned veterans inside of themselves when they played live. Unwound has a lot of energy packed into their music, and the fact that 30 years later they’re still able to convey that is a blessing. Sara Lund and Justin Trosper fucking rock. RIP Vern.\nSquid #This band caught my attention back in 2021 with their album Bright Green Field and I’ve been obsessed ever since. Always eagerly awaiting any crumb of new music they drop. I love their music, their visuals, their message, their energy, and so much more. However when it was finally time to see them at Union Transfer, I was a little worried. Squid is a 5 piece band with a lot of sounds going on, so I was concerned that they wouldn’t be able to capture that sound live. I had high expectations of them, and their music certainly gets complicated. Thankfully my worries were squashed, and my mind melted at that show as I lost myself in the pit screaming every lyric to every song. They played all my favorites and brought me into their world so far that I forgot who I was that evening. They did for me what I hoped they would do and then some.\nJulie #If you follow this blog you know I don\u0026rsquo;t shut up about this band. I already knew what to expect when I saw them at Brooklyn Bowl, but seeing them at Ukie Club the first time was a sight of pure destruction. Their presence and their energy matched the music perfectly. Even though I was somewhat sick and stood off to the side for this show, beholding the powerhouse that is Julie warmed my heart.\nAnnie DiRusso #I saw Annie DiRusso open for Declan Mckenna in D.C. I didn’t have much expectations, except that she was opening for my beloved British lad. So she must have something to say. What I got was some truly authentic and personal songwriting with melodies to match. I really really felt her emotions, and thank god the venue had good sound because I was able to hear everything she said. She also did this cool technique with the microphone where she screamed and shook her head back and forth to create this sort of vibrato effect. Just a super freaking solid act.\nGodcaster #I saw Godcaster at Johnny Brenda’s and heard good things about them. I’m not sure if I checked out their music before or after, but they absolutely were a pleasant surprise to see live. The people I went with (some Wallace, Tonight homies) were excited to see Grocer, who was the opening act. Grocer, who is worth checking out as well. When Godcaster started, I saw a show I did not expect at all. All of the sudden their shirtless lead singer was menacingly strutting towards me into the crowd with an acoustic guitar. It reminded me of being scared by ghouls and goblins on the haunted hayrides I went on as a kid. Only this was genuinely a little scarier, as I had no idea what he would do. Their music was unique to me at the time, and I highly recommend listening to their self-titled album. Godcaster. The drawn out buildups into crescendos, their large and talented ensemble, and the piercing vocal chops on all the singers, ultimately showed me that Godcaster is in their own lane. I love the Diamond\u0026rsquo;s Shining Face music video.\nPalomino Blond #I got to see this Florida band at MiniMart in West Philly. I might admit that all the expectations I had of them was that they got on this bill because they had some roots with Her New Knife. But wow, and holy crap! What I love about this venue is that there is a second level that allows you to view the bands from above. I decided to go up there for this show and it was such a treat. They were all exceptionally talented, but their drummer blew me away to another world as their chops captivated me on a spiritual level.\nBuice #Buice, pronounced “Bised”, are the experimental noise homies from Atlanta. We were fortunate enough to play with them on their most recent tour at Stupid Baby’s. I listened to their record One Day You’ll See The Sun a few times before we played with them and the way they brought this record to life was music to my ears. Literally. I remember I didn’t want their set to end. If you check them out, make sure to check out their guitarist’s Jack’s other band Strumbrush while you\u0026rsquo;re at it.\nGumby’s Junk #Yeah I haven’t seen too many acts like this before. This three piece played with the one and only Mormon Toaster Head last October at the 700, and boy am I glad I got to see them. They were a pre-rehearsed masterpiece. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t tell what time signature they were in the whole time as I’m positive it changed bar to bar. I loved their synthy sounding tone choices as well. If you have ADHD, you’ll love this band. If they ever come to the east coast again they are a must see. I hope they keep at it. Also bonus points for having Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes on their merch.\nDidn’t Meet My Expectations #The Strokes #Don’t get me wrong, I love the Strokes. Like, a lot. They are in fact one of my favorite bands of all time. What I was let down the most by their set was the fact that they only played two songs off of their new album, which is one of my favorite albums of all time, The New Abnormal. And no, one of those songs was not my most favorite at the time, “Ode to the Mets”. Of course they aren’t going to play exactly what I’d like to, but only two?! Really !? On top of that they played at a baseball stadium. They played at a baseball stadium and didn’t play “Ode to the Mets”? Shake my head fr. I was unfortunately unfamiliar with the other songs they chose to play at the time. Julian Casablancas also seemed so beat, likely because he was. Where I cut them some slack is the fact that they weren’t the headlining act. This wasn’t their tour. No, that went to the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Who absolutely killed it, like I knew they would. Thundercat also played and I learned very quickly that I was sleeping on him as he was popping off. One last thing I’ll add is that I was in the nose bleeds for this show, so maybe a better spot would have made all of it better.\nDominic Fike #I saw Dominic Fike at the Firefly festival in Dover, DE. And yes at the time I was very into him as a junior in college. I saw him perform that song “Photo ID” together with Remi Wolf and that was very much awesome. I will forever cherish that as one of my favorite concert moments of all time, however his own set was a bit underwhelming and lackluster. I don’t know what drugs or drinks he was on, but he seemed out of it. The popularity of his songs let the crowd do a lot of the heavy lifting and although I think he has a lot of talent, this was a rough one for playing one of the biggest stages at a festival.\nKid Cudi #I decided to see Kid Cudi at Wells Fargo Center. I actually liked some of his newer stuff at the time. Seeing him was important to me because listening to Man on the Moon in 8th grade opened up my world of music and experiencing it. It made me musically sentient, and made me begin to seek out music I liked and not just listen to whatever the radio fed me. He made me feel and enjoy music like no one else did. I would listen to “Day N Nite” and “Pursuit of Happiness” religiously as well as some other oldies of his. I’m certainly older than I was in 8th grade, so seeing him live in 2022 told me that I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have expected what middle school me thought I\u0026rsquo;d get.\nYoung Thug #Although I didn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily have expectations for Young Thug, I did not expect him to unimpress me to the level he did. I figured he might be a “if you know you know” kind of artist. Specifically with knowing what he’s saying. I know he’s pioneered to a degree the vocally centered vocal styles in modern rap music, but he did the same hand movements and didn’t leave the center of the stage the whole time. He stayed at the mic, and did not match the energy I thought Jaden Smith had before him, and J. Cole did after him. This was one of the first concerts I’ve ever seen at Penn State. It was in 2018. I didn’t like him then, and I still don’t like him now.\nJean Dawson #This can most likely be summarized by the fact that I haven’t been into Jean Dawson’s new stuff as much as I am into his old. His album Pixel Bath helped me at a time in my life that was mentally rough. And if I were to make music at that time, I thoroughly believe it would’ve sounded like him. I got some comp tickets for his recent show at the TLA for his tour of his new album and to be direct and honest, I think I’ve just outgrown his music. His new stuff has not clicked for me. Despite perhaps having the usual themes of his, the energy feels like it was taken down a notch. He’s not in the same artistic era I know him from. He’s at a different point in his journey. He\u0026rsquo;s on a different path now. People change, as they should. I just hope he’s doing what he wants. I’d still make music with him in a heartbeat.\nSpirit of the Beehive #I saw them packed onto a little stage at Johnny Brenda’s not too long ago. Sometimes popular bands have one off shows at smaller local venues so that they can work out any kinks for when they play larger shows. I believe this might have been that. They were very professional, and I was impressed with all their individual setups and instrument swappings. I might be wrong, but I am pretty sure there were 6 of them on the stage. Which is cutting it close at Johnny Brenda’s, especially if you have as many instruments as they did. Overall I\u0026rsquo;m down to blame my expectations not being met on the venue as I think they were not able to mix and handle the wide array of sounds which is Spirit of the Beehive. Ultimately it was still a good show. I loved hearing “THE DOOR IS CLOSING” live. Seeing them at what may have been the height of my obsession with them may also mean that I set the bar a little too high. I liked their new album YOU’LL HAVE TO LOSE SOMETHING, so go give it a listen if you haven’t already and so that they don\u0026rsquo;t hate me.\n","date":"17 November 2024","permalink":"/blog/2024/expectations/","section":"Blog","summary":"As the title says.","title":"Concerts that exceeded my expectations, and concerts that didn't."},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/dominic-fike/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Dominic Fike"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/glass-animals/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Glass Animals"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/godcaster/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Godcaster"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/gumbys-junk/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Gumby's Junk"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/jean-dawson/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Jean Dawson"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/julie/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Julie"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/kid-cudi/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Kid Cudi"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/palomino-blond/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Palomino Blond"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/spirit-of-the-beehive/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Spirit of the Beehive"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/squid/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Squid"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/tame-impala/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tame Impala"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/the-strokes/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"The Strokes"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/unwound/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Unwound"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/young-thug/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Young Thug"},{"content":"10/25/24 #There is a rave tonight. Still debating on going. I was going to go as David Foster Wallace.\nThis month will surely be known as the month that I finally got my ducks in a row. Or at least I hope so. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if I say the same thing next month.\nA dry-erase board with a self designed grid is going to be deciding what I\u0026rsquo;ll be doing everyday for the forseeable future. The far forseeable future. It sits above my desk and designates what I\u0026rsquo;ll be doing that week, and on what day. Whiteboards are quite a good investment. You only need a small one, or really anything to draw on easily.\nArt is important. The back of my mind has been pushing me to draw more recently although I am not too good at it. I mean I\u0026rsquo;m decent. I never have the patience to draw something well. I\u0026rsquo;ll start with one thing. Perhaps a chair. I start drawing it carefully. Then I get bored and start drawing other things. I draw them faster and faster taking less and less time on each one. Clearly showing me how my brain works and the lack of patience it has. Perhaps I could\u0026rsquo;ve been great. Drawing and painting was just something that I never really gravitated towards. I did a little bit, but not nearly as much as other things.\nI saw Julie with Her New Knife on Wednesday. I brought my fish eye lens and threw some of the live footage up on my YouTube. The lens just goes on the front of my iPhone. You can find them on Amazon.\nTonight I have an art show for my friend Dan Biederman. This dude is the guy. Does that make sense? Dan has been around quite a bit. I absolutely love his work. He curated this art show himself so I\u0026rsquo;m excited to see it. Dimmer is very likely going to have him make the artwork for our projects. Dan used to live one street behind me when we both went to Temple. We had a alot of mutuals, its kind of crazy. That\u0026rsquo;s the tea.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also decided that I would like to start intereviewing bands. I\u0026rsquo;m going to start with my homies and then work my way up.

Just trying to get back into it.\nI think I may have these blogs act as either journal entries or be actual pieces of journalism from now on. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to stop the mish mashing of both. People want the juice they\u0026rsquo;re looking for, not my bullshit. I mean I\u0026rsquo;ll still have my bullshit on here.

I\u0026rsquo;ve been suffering the effects of being chronically on the internet and staring at a screen for hours everyday since I was a child.\nI just listened to “I am Mothman\u0026quot; by Buice. Also I’m relistening to Census Designated by “Jane Remover”. I don’t know if I’m into the whole digicore thing, maybe I need to give it some relistens. I like the emotions pouring out. “I am Mothman” is an absolute crescendo of experimental noise and energy screaming out of Hayden and the rest. I just fucking love music. I can’t believe that anyone can make it at the level we do now. There has never been a better time to make music than right now. I think everyone should start doing as much as they can of whatever they want before A.I. ruins everything.\nI always feel so much more at peace when I’m doing something. I don’t have a good on and off switch for productivity. How I have operated for a very long time now is periods of either work mode or doing nothing. I always get burnt out inevitably, and then periods where I’m doing “nothing” is me doing the bare minimum. The “bare minimum” has changed over the years but at this point it\u0026rsquo;s in a good state. I am still committed to working out on weekdays, and I’m still committed to music. But it’s not paying the bills, and I think this life of living out of touch with reality needs to come to an end. Or not that exactly. I am a hundred percent out of touch in a very self-aware manner. Or at least I\u0026rsquo;d like to think so. I took time to explore, travel, try new things, see what works, see what doesn’t, network. And I got things out of my system. I used to want to travel and see everything. Instead I decided I am more than grateful that I got to see the sights I got to see in my life as they’re incredible. I got to go to all kinds of places and countries, meet all kinds of people. But wherever you go, there you are. It\u0026rsquo;s time to lock myself in a room and “hone in on my ish” (The words of the great jasper.heart). A big house, money, health, those are all nice to have. But one must live a life indifferent towards these factors if one is to feel fulfilled everyday.\nPeople have different ideas of success. This is not my personal idea, but I think that the general population’s idea of success is gaining money (and maybe fame along with it), by pursuing wealth directly. If you are working hard at something, and money is the ultimate reason why, then you become a hollow shell of a person. (I am not talking about individuals who need to work a job they don’t like to pay the bills.) Narcissists are rewarded in our society, it’s encouraged. Anything out of sight is out of mind in business, so it’s a job well done when you finally get all your company’s manufacturing moved offshore.\nSometimes I feel like I’ve been nothing but a horrible person. I’ve been reconsidering getting an actual job again as I think that the job I had may have just been a uniquely aggravating one to me. Not all jobs are the same. No job is the same actually. Jane Remover is spitting.\nRecently I’ve had the thought to curl up in a fetal position in some hiding spot no one will find me. Is that cringe to share? I think it\u0026rsquo;s corny whenever I hear “curl up in the fetal position”. Who actually does that? Apparently me recently, or a part of me. I don’t think I was made for this world sometimes. Perhaps it’ll click better in the next life. Do you think we have souls?\nYou know I’d obviously rather become who I am and feel confident and sure of myself. I guess who wouldn’t? I want to put in the work, but it\u0026rsquo;s not like building legos. It\u0026rsquo;s not simple. You don’t stack bricks one at a time until it\u0026rsquo;s made. That’s how I\u0026rsquo;m always used to it as schoolwork was always clear and linear. Instead it\u0026rsquo;s like jumping off a cliff. It’s all these giant leaps. Aches and pains and triumphs. You don’t even know if it\u0026rsquo;s the right cliff. Or at least that’s how I feel.\nWhen you question everything that you are, and realize you might not know who you are because of what you went through and how things are, well… You have to figure out what parts of you that you show are you, what parts of you aren’t, and what parts of you you’ve denied and kept hidden for so long. So long that you don’t even know what they are yet. You have to come from a place of complete acceptance and love for yourself. You, and everyone else, are the universe loving itself.\nI always get along with people who I feel intuitively are messed up. We all are. But I can sense when people are too hard on themselves. I’m definitely one of those people. I realized a long time ago that no one cares, I have to relearn this fact to myself again.\nI’m tired.\nI just reread everything I wrote and it\u0026rsquo;s like “ugh”. It\u0026rsquo;s good, it\u0026rsquo;s fine, it\u0026rsquo;s healthy. I’m fine at this moment. I hope this doesn’t come across as an “everybody feel bad for me” thing. Feeling bad for yourself holds you back, but I think there is a line to cross where you don’t hold yourself back, and you end up becoming blind to the things you do wrong. I get worried about being blind and arrogant because a part of me feels like I’m the last person who should.\n","date":"31 August 2024","permalink":"/blog/2024/bare-minimum/","section":"Blog","summary":"General blog I guess.

I woke up at 6:30am and went to the Atilis gym. I was in Ocean City because I was on vacation with my family. I got back to our hotel and showered quickly, packed up, and then proceeded to Glen Mills, PA.\nIt was there I had a meeting with a modeling agency. I scheduled an appointment with a barbershop in the same plaza the agency had their office at. I had some downtime in between appointments so I walked over to the Hilton nearby to do some nomad work in their lobby. While I was in the lobby I did some work on my website. I wanted to fix some issues I had with it and I eventually fixed all of them. After all this it was about 6pm and at that point I headed to Swarthmore college as there was a show happening there. Cats on Mushrooms was playing with Supermarket Parking Lot and Prisoners of Love. They were all phenomenal to say the least. I got to hop up on stage and sang Head in the Ceiling Fan with Matt.\nI snapped a few pics and talked to the owner of the venue. It\u0026rsquo;s called Warehouse 3. I made a new page on the Philly Scenesite for it.\nI drove home.\nFriday was a similarly busy day that I don’t feel like explaining in detail. Very busy. Doing very different things. There were some coaching calls, one of which opened my eyes.\nIt was only after this call where I unraveled and broke down and questioned, “What do I actually want out of life? What do I actually want to do? Why am I doing all these things? What are my expectations?”\nWhat led me to getting a coaching call where I was going to pay some dude to help me with what I already know how to do? Why did I think I needed him? What did I think he could give me?\n(I also saw Milly and Fiddlehead Saturday the 27th. Or at least I went to that concert for those bands specifically. Soul Blind and Gel were a pleasant suprise.)\n8/23/2024 Epiphanies #Anyways, about that epiphany… I did have it, and I have had yet another one recently. I have realized that in order to fit in my whole life, in order to survive the psychological wargames of social hierarchies and socialization in general, I have to put on a show of sorts. I do things to get by in social situations rather than just be myself. Everyone does to an extent. But I feel I lack the same instilled reactions others have. I don’t have all of the typical unconscious and automatic reactions others have to things.\nWhile I was in Colorado last week, I decided to partake in some of the state’s finest edible delicacies. For the last ten years of my life I have been around things containing THC, and people that consume it. And for the most part, except for when I’m alone, I get super freaking paranoid. I go non-verbal often. And I did in CO. I am suddenly trying to be aware of every little interaction. I am scared of being perceived. Thoughts of the future cripple me with paranoia. I become aware of far too much.\nTo be honest with myself here, I hid a lot of parts of myself as I got older. I stopped letting them come out, and I stopped expressing myself in all these ways. I kept niche interests to myself unless someone else brought them up or I was around someone who I knew had the same interests. I loved making videos as a kid, I loved to sing, I loved to perform, but as I got older I got too self-conscious of these things and buried them as no one else was interested.\nEver since Colorado, everything in my life has started to make sense. I realized, and thoroughly believe to an extent, that I not \u0026ldquo;neurotypical\u0026rdquo;. Most people say, “Yeah, everybody is on the spectrum to some degree.”, but I believe that inside of me, knowing who I am and what I’ve done and how I’ve experienced the world, that I have it more than I think. I’m more neurodivergent than I’ve led myself to believe. And that’s okay, I now have more clarity and can be more accommodating to myself than ever before. I can start getting better at being myself. Because fuck social norms. Fuck the idea that something is wrong with people who don’t come across the same way as others.\nI guess I won’t get into too many specifics about myself. It is a taboo subject, and a part of me doesn’t feel right to self-diagnose myself. I acknowledge that there are people, for example with autism, who can’t even talk at all. I\u0026rsquo;m nowhere close to that. I won\u0026rsquo;t be getting any official diagnosis anytime soon.\nWhen I was a kid I played with action figures. I played with them a lot. (I still do sometimes.) But it would be so much more than that. There would be full narratives, character arcs, season long conflicts, and so much more. I would be able to see everything happening in my head so clearly, all I’d need is the figurines. As far as I’m concerned I’ve written and directed and did sound for hundreds of films and TV shows in my head, and I think that’s pretty cool. It’s why I hope to finally make more videos, and more music too.\nI’ve always had similar abilities to create music in my head in a very vivid way. But without the confidence or ability to play I never got into it until I picked up a guitar three years ago.\nI know myself enough to truly consider the fact that my mind is missing some default software and this has been the sneaky thing in my life I’ve been trying to identify. The thing that is still making me feel like something is wrong. However I’m not buying shirts, telling everyone I meet about it, and making it my whole personality. I would just like to acknowledge it, here and now, as it has provided me with a lot of clarity and I can hopefully be much more accommodating and understanding to myself going forward.\nSo to tie this in with that coaching call, and my present day actions, I realized that I will never be who I thought I was ultimately going to be. I mean I believe I could do anything I set my mind to, but if I kept on the current track I would end up hating my life. I believe I am capable of anything, so I thought I had this obligation to get as much money and power as possible. To help my family, and to be one of the forces of good in the sphere of rich individuals. I think everybody with immense wealth and power believes that they are the lesser of the other evils around them. If I weren’t the greedy and corrupt billionaire, then another person, more corrupt and more greedy will take my place, so I must retain my position at all costs. This belief, as I’ve come to realize, is utter bullshit.\nPursuing money for money itself will leave you completely empty. You will keep leveling up in an environment that is not based on true human connections. It\u0026rsquo;s based on money. You’ll give into impulsive pleasures once money is not a problem. For the most part, I think losing touch with reality, becoming blinded by privilege, and putting business before everything else is the inevitable outcome for any human that goes all in on this path.\nI don’t think there is any foolproof way to generate money in an ethical way. Not in this day and age. In every business model, at some point, you are ripping off the client. This is not only known, but encouraged and perhaps the problem that started it all. The idea is that extra money one makes is set aside so they could live comfortably and put their money towards other businesses. With greed instilled in us, the narcissists of this world will take advantage of this as far as they can.\nI’m getting a little off track. If you are passionate about your business, then good for you, I’m not trying to dissuade individuals from the grind. I’ve met entrepreneurs with pure intentions. I’m trying to say that it\u0026rsquo;s not natural, so don’t get too caught up in it. Don’t do it for money alone. It will not alleviate any personal problems except for financial ones. Often it may not even alleviate that.\nThis was my great epiphany, or my great epiphanies I should say. Combining them has made me tunnel visioned to pursue the stuff I am actually passionate about rather than what I think is most practical. I admit that I have some privilege being able to attempt this. Don’t ever hold yourself back because you fear being seen as privileged. Do it for those who would kill to be in your position. People are rooting for you. The universe is rooting for you to make the best choices for yourself and everyone else alike.\nUltimately, my overarching self-narrative about gaining power and money because I’m obligated to fight in the higher arena of good vs. evil is well… crazy. I thought that because I can get to the same level of the true elite in this world that I must do so so that I may make a difference. Fight against evil. Defeat the bad guys. It sounds so delusional and absurd to type out, but it\u0026rsquo;s true. As if the world has ever been black and white… I was always a dreamer.\nNow, I think things are just going to run their course. No one is to blame. If something happens, that means that it was always possible. We can all try to prevent catastrophe. We can keep manipulating our environment, but the sun is still going to explode. I will sacrifice my life for my soul’s purpose and if everyone else did that, maybe we’d be at peace. Sounds like I’m a hippie I guess?\nI’ve never felt more at peace with myself than I have in the past week. I’ve felt like I\u0026rsquo;ve finally gotten over the curve I’ve been stuck on and can start making actual progress. Thanks Colorado.\nSucceeding in modern business is gross to me. The business of modern capitalism is unethical and based around corrupted fiat currencies. So until the world from my blockchain fantasies comes to fruition with its perfect, secure, decentralized, and global digital currency, my advice is to sit back and enjoy the ride. Stop wanting a million times more than what you have now. It’ll take away your gratitude. Desire a new car, not a sports car. If you pursue a path that has pure intentions and is inline with who you are, when you get fortunes you never thought you would have, you will not desire them anymore.\nI’m not positive the world can continue the way it’s going. I give my life to music and the arts. I give my life to the culture. I inspire others and I hope to be more dramatic and assertive about my convictions. When the time comes I will change course. I will be grateful for the life of devotion I served before the storm comes. I’m sure it will come within my lifetime.\n","date":"23 August 2024","permalink":"/blog/2024/thursday-friday/","section":"Blog","summary":"Two epiphanies come together to make me stop and realize I\u0026rsquo;m not going to be that entrepreneur-bro-sigma-male-grindset.","title":"My Thursday Friday \u0026 Ephiphanies"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/channel-65/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Channel 65"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/dimmer/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Dimmer"},{"content":"6/16/23 Nose Update #Dang fam, it\u0026rsquo;s been a while. I’ve been pretty busy since I quit my job. I skimmed the last blog post I made and saw that I was mentioned having these depressive episodes. I still kind of have them, but I just kind of accept them when they happen and now they’ve been happening farther and fewer.\nI’ve been back home in my hometown of Scranton, PA. I went and sang a Title Fight cover down at the Hyperview sign and I’m going to throw it up on YouTube soon. Other than that I was recovering from a nose surgery to correct my deviated septum. It was rough and left me completely incapacitated for 5 days or so. I don’t recommend nose surgery, but if you do I recommend Dr. Nyquist at Jefferson haha.\n6/18/23 Lil Buddy #I’m looking for a new car. Mine is having too many problems. I haven’t been able to have a real hard workout since my nose surgery and I can’t for at least another week and a half. I have a lot of anxiety as I write this. For a lot of reasons. I think I’ve returned to this blog to make it better. Writing helps. (Sometime soon I’m going to finally put this blog on my website for all to see.) The immediate anxiety I can feel however is about these Instagram reels I made. I tried to make a stupid joke about being gay and doing crime in my caption, and I got what I believed was deserved criticism. Although I have to learn to be immune to the haters I think this moment solidified that I have to be extra careful on certain topics. The anxiety I’ve gotten from the Instagram reels I’ve made has been pretty wild. I have a hard time looking at the anxiety and the situation from an objective point of view, but as time has gone on I’ve gotten better and better at it. I made them mostly for myself. I’ve gained insight into myself. And I’ve made progress with this fear of the online perception of myself. Progress with the fear of preserving my online persona. Whatever the heck that is. It\u0026rsquo;s fodder. It\u0026rsquo;s blah blah blah. With the reels, I set the bar low on purpose.\nSince I’ve been home I’ve hung out with Albert Kausmeyer quite a bit. He’s in two bands here in Scranton. Pollen and Bullied by The Elderly. Pollen is a Scranton super group. Their bassist is in All Day Special. Their songwriter and guitarist Caleb was in a different band back in Texas where he’s from. And their drummer, Ian, is in Channel 65. I love them all.\nI made a video for Channel 65 and their song “Lil Buddy” and it came out perfect! I seriously haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten sick of it. It conjures the vibe its going for. Go watch it: Albert recorded the music for “Lil Buddy” at his home studio, which I had the pleasure of seeing yesterday. It was like an oasis of instruments and microphones and interfaces. I always love seeing the Scarlett 18i20. It was clear to me when I saw his home studio that Albert is a league above me as far as gear knowledge goes. I don’t know the first thing about recording to be honest, except that experimentation is key. A one inch misplacement of a microphone is more noticeable than it being changed from analog to digital. So get freaky with your gear and your recording equipment. Maybe Dimmer will record at his house. We’ll have to wait and see. I know that I want Dimmer to sound really full and mixed and mastered well. While still remaining rough around the edges. I feel like if an audio engineer in a studio heard me say that they’d roll their eyes.\nI’m trying to work on my own project soon. I want to have something that is all mine. Obviously I want to be open to suggestions but I want full creative control. I’m a performer at heart. And I have a lot of personal shit to express. I was going to revive the name “2Long”, but I don’t want to run another social media account. “2Long” might be the name of the album. The thought of having access to and running multiple instagrams is nauseating.\nIt really is peaceful back home. I wish I was doing more fun things with other adolescent folk. Everybody I know works like a dog. Especially back home. No young people I know have both the time and money to do fun stuff. I think maybe they lost the attitude to have fun as well.\nI hate worrying about money. Sometimes this world makes me absolutely sick. I’m so thankful for my friends and family.\nI think I narrowed down what I want to do with my life for the foreseeable future. I’ll keep you posted.\n6/21/24 More Shows #The news happens to be on as I’m writing this. It\u0026rsquo;s saying how Louisiana and Texas are putting the Ten Commandments in every classroom. What a slippery slope that seems to be.\nI just put a deposit down to have a show and vendor festival at St. Mary’s Center in Scranton. Kayla Grezch has been helping me a lot as she is more familiar with the diy scene in Scranton than I am. She\u0026rsquo;s got the knack for making nice things to look as well. Dimmer just got our housing situation settled for our Penn State show July 13th. We\u0026rsquo;re playing Penn State Fest. I’m excited to play with our friend Bennett. Also Benji and Mike and Prim (Chicago Fire) are playing with Sun Organ and Fib at Cousin Danny’s. There’s also some Asheville bands on the bill I’m excited to hear as well. I’m excited for that show so I hope it\u0026rsquo;s swag money. I saw Sun Organ not too long ago at Love City Brewing, but I didn’t get a chance to talk to Tim. I’m a big fan of Sun Organ, and I love its production. Fib too. If you’re signed to Jwar, there is a good chance I’m a fan.\n6/24/24 Windy Website Work #It was windy today. Like windy as a curse word. I’m still back in Scranton. I finally started real work on my website today. It uses Hugo and I am slowly starting to learn how to use it. Hugo is a static website generator that uses Go to be lightning fast. My friend Jay Rush uses it for Trueblocks.io and Jeff used it for the Philly Scene site.\nI’m hoping to finally get all these blogs onto my website. I think the other stuff will change overtime but the blog will be consistent and I’ll have tags so you the reader can parse through my nonsense a little bit. I have a lot to read but I am excited to go through all my posts and see how different my headspace and daily activities looked compared to now.\nIn therapy today I talked about how I want to be held more accountable. So I decided to take more of a life coach approach with them. I have clearly defined tasks that I need to complete between our sessions. If I don’t complete them we’re going to analyze why. It\u0026rsquo;s almost like I’m making my therapist my teacher and I have homework due. Might as well use the brainwashed pathways I have installed in my head to my own advantage here. The brainwashing of academia I mean. Of school and studying and assignment due dates. I got all my work done in school and it made me stressed out, but this time I’m assigning my own homework. No one’s grading me except myself. And there’s no actual punishment for missing deadlines, but here I can trick myself into thinking that. I may be oversharing here but dear reader, maybe you can try the same strategy some day. I don’t have any results yet, but I do have high hopes about a productivity idea for once.\nOn a final note I’m finally escaping Scranton this Wednesday. I got a boxy and sharp SUV. Let\u0026rsquo;s get it. Time to build credit.\n6/28/24 Shady’s back #Yo check it out I can insert code markup right onto the blog! Here’s the Hugo command I use to generate a new blog post:\nhugo new blog/2023/julie-work/index.md I’m back in the wonderful city of Philadelphia and I’ll admit that things felt right almost instantly. Back home feels so slow compared to my life here and I’m not saying one is better than the other, but I feel so much more right to be in the city. I\u0026rsquo;m a city slicker.\nI went to Philamoca two days ago to see Teethe, People I Love, and 22° Halo. These bands fit really well together on this bill. There were no mosh pits. Which was very surprising. I want to try and talk about bands after I see them live. This show was one of those shows where I like to stand in a good spot in the venue so I can hear the sound the best. I then close my eyes and let the music take me aways. All of these bands are perfect for that. I recommend all of that if you’re trying to get into more somber, melancholy, and thematic music.\nThe influence that came to mind when I listened to Teethe for the first time was the band Duster. The way they ride out the melodies and add vocal harmonies with it are magical. God, I feel like Fantano. If you connect with it, its fantastic. I reccommend their self-titled.\nPeople I Love is creatively steered the most I believe by Dan from the acts Waveform* and Lola Star. There seems to be a pace of musicians from these three bands (Waveform*, People I Love, and Lola Star) who collaborate together. To the extent I don’t know, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s fair to say given their drummer Avery plays for all three bands. I binged as many People I Love songs as I could before the show. And they were great to hear live. I think the songs are a bit zany, in a good way, but I personally like the lyrics and unique production the most.\n22° Halo is a band I was put onto a while ago, and their soft music was just what I needed at the time. Its soft and nice. Listening them to me live brought me to a happy quiet place. This band is a vibe in their own right and I hope Will Kennedy and the rest of them can keep making stuff and stay in the Philly scene as time goes on. I saw them before at Mini Mart, standing on the balcony above them, but this time on the ground level it felt more intimate.\nThat Mini Mart show was also where I believed to have met Sebastian from Bedridden, who was also at this show at Philamoca. We complained about back pain from standing too long, which may be the topic of a future blog post.\n\u0026ldquo;Back pain at shows and why its worth the suffering.\u0026rdquo;\nAlso, did you try out the light mode for the website?

I still struggle to recognize when I need to take time to relax and do nothing.\nI don’t know what I want to do with this blog. I don’t know if it will be public.

I quit my job. I need to make money. I’m either going big or going home. Everything feels a lot more dramatic now. Because I’m trying to be very decisive about what I’m doing with every second of my day. I’ve even wondered if this blog is worth it. At the time of writing this I still have not released it anywhere. No one knows it exists except me. I think I hope that people can find this one day and see it as inspiring. My soul wants to express itself. I’m finally trying to allow that to happen.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s funny as I start this journey it feels like my life has just started. It feels like everything I’ve done in school and college has largely been a waste, and I would have been better off partying. I could’ve expanded my network more. As I start this journey I also feel misunderstood. I can already tell that this is a lonesome path. For a while, it will be an individual journey. I think there is some truth to that quote “lonely at the top,\u0026quot; but I don’t like the words “at the top”. Because I feel like that implies that someone at the “top” is above all others. I hear the label “successful entrepreneur”, and my mind quickly turns that label into “money-hungry sociopath”. How else would someone acquire immense wealth at such a young age? Maybe I’ve been brainwashed. Is every person interested in business filled with the spiritual ignorance I sense? To what degree?\nI’ve been growing up with so many people around me saying capitalism is bad. And all I want to say about that, at this moment, is that that thinking has made me think the world is bad. That the world we live in is the worst and is going to end in tragedy. How even if I gave a homeless person some food, that I am still perpetuating the system that keeps them there. Which in that case I objectivley would be. I don’t know what the truest words are to describe our reality, but I know that with the short time I have on this earth I don’t want to have any existential ideas cemented in my head that bring me anxiety, depression, and a sense of hopelessness. It\u0026rsquo;s too short to ever think otherwise. And that’s not ignorant, that’s just logical. I’ve come to a new way of thinking, hopefully not to justify my endeavors of the next few months, but I have to obtain power in the current system we have as well as understand it if I want to change it. We won’t change from capitalism to communism overnight or to any other form of government. If it does happen over night then it won’t be for the better. Instead it must be a gradual transition. And that’s why I hang on tightly to my blockchain governance fantasies. A perfect indisputable currency and voting system where everyone can participate. Am I making sense?\n2/6/24 I’m Anxious #I had a long talk with my dad today. We tend to have those often. In my senior year of college, I have felt what I think was the early stages of a panic attack. It happened for no apparent reason, and always happened in class. All of the sudden I just felt like something overwhelming was about to happen. Panic attacks essentially are a feedback loop where you get anxiety about how much anxiety you\u0026rsquo;re feeling and it just skyrockets until your system implodes.\nI’m feeling pretty anxious today. I’m blaming some of it on my horrible sleep schedule. (I slept from 6 am to 9:30 today.) But I also get these bouts of it although it has been getting better. I think I’ve pushed stuff to the side for now in my mind. I don’t want to get hung up on old worries anymore. I don’t want these unconscious social hierarchies to be in my way, but yet I still feel like I don’t know my place. Look, I have a lot going on inside me. Sometimes it slows me down. It stops me in my tracks. I’ve done the therapy. I’ve found great outlets but it still persists. And I don’t know what will come of it. Perhaps a panic attack will come. The point is that I’m at a point where I don’t care what happens. I’m ready to embrace the panic attack. I’m ready to fail. To be seen failing. To be embarrassed. To be perceived. I don’t have any time to waste anymore. I want to go on and get living.\nI had a meeting with a “dropshipping” guy today. It was a free consultation type deal and everything was going great but unfortunately he couldn’t be of service. Dropshipping is a full time job I straight up don\u0026rsquo;t want to do. I told him all I was doing. Working out every morning and meal prepping, making music and committing to things. I’m trying to start and stay consistent with a YouTube channel, I’m trying to do the same with another YouTube channel, I’m trying to get into Blockchain, I thought about trying stand up comedy, I’m trying to make a personal website for this blog.\nI’m trying to do too much. I want to do it all. I’m at a point in my life where I have limitless possibilities. But I need to choose only a few. And I need to commit.\nI can do anything, but I can’t do everything.\nI know I want to get into great physical condition. And I know I want to show my progress to some degree. I know I want to eat healthy and get my protein and other nutrients to carve out the body I know I deserve for myself. Shoutout to my personal trainer Sammy. He\u0026rsquo;s uncl3slam on IG.\nOk, so that settles that. We’re doing that. Preferably every morning first thing.\nI know at night I want to read and journal to wind down, instead of going on my phone. I want to plug it in across my room with a 6am alarm on.\nI know I want to be in a band. I’m still working on figuring that out. I want to make stuff in the evening. Just start making shit and see what happens. I have all the instruments I want. All the technology and resources I need. The creativity and vision is in me. There is commitment from my bandmates. Support from the community. And it satisfies my spirit on a whole different plane.\nSo working out, eating right, less phone time, reading, writing, and music. All things that won’t take up all my time. But all things that really won’t sustain me at the current moment. Some of this can surely be skills I can cultivate to a point where I can eventually consider myself a professional. And then one way or another those skills can bring me things to survive. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s teaching, or performing, or influencing, whatever. I think it\u0026rsquo;s possible.\nBut what about what I do between 9-5. Those hours where my typical job should fit in. This is where I don’t know what to do. I think it\u0026rsquo;s a lucrative investment to build up and market my parent’s jewelry online. I think with some time and effort I can build up a system so that it doesn’t take a whole lot of time out of my day to complete. At first it might be a lot. But with time it will be tamed.\nI have wanted to do YouTube for a long time. I have multiple entire scripts ready. I see the vision in myself. I just need to develop the skills and make the time. I know I’ll enjoy it. I’m still a little anxious but I think sticking to my scripts will let me be the articulate character I want to put out there. I’ll do it.\nEverything else for the most part will have to wait until these are up and running. Or at least that’s what I envision at this moment.\n","date":"3 February 2024","permalink":"/blog/2024/quit-job/","section":"Blog","summary":"I finally quit my job.

I finally put in my 2 weeks at the glorious ASRC (AFMS). Or more specifically Artic Regional Slope Corporation Federal Mission Solutions. My last day is next Friday. Today is Thursday. I am going to genuinely pursue about 10 different businesses if I’m guessing correctly. All of various sorts. I’m not even counting the music as part of it. (Side note: Still upset I missed Wednesday and Echotracer and Hotline TNT at Union Transfer. At least FLH is back and playing at Coachella.)\nHere’s a YouTube rant video I made about my job and quitting it:\nI really need to get my PC working and my Wi-Fi working. I have just been really intimidated by it. It\u0026rsquo;s a combination of the Wi-Fi and my own PC’s nonsense that is causing this to happen. My bandmates said they’ll help me. My roommate has already been battling with Comcast. I need to buy Adobe Premiere Pro and maybe photoshop. And definitely a nice camera. I’ll see if they have a bundle. I also bought a bass and studio monitors this month. The studio monitors I have were claimed to be the ones used to produce the original Kidz Bop albums. Or at least some of them. I don\u0026rsquo;t know officially, but I believe the guy I bought them off of because why not?\nMy old friend from highschool, Samuel Morgan, is now my personal trainer. He’s a little more than that though. He’s a special soul and a beacon of positivity and faith. So I think it will work out perfectly. I’m ready to put in the work at the gym when I quit my job. And oh man oh man can I not wait.\nuncl3slam on IG.\nI won’t explicitly say my finances, but I have a lot saved up and I’m hoping it lasts me at least until next year in Philly. People look at me in disbelief when they hear that I don’t have another job lined up. But I really really don’t care. This is not what I signed up for when I put the past 16 years of my life into academia? I didn\u0026rsquo;t work this hard to get what I feel is absolutely no where near where I want to be. Where I think I could be. These people don’t know me. And the people who have done the same and failed, also aren’t me. You have to have some insanity when you quit your job and pursue your silly little dreams like me. Or at least be somewhat aware of it, which I think am.\nIt is insane. i do have privilege, but that is no reason to stop myself. I have been dealt a good hand, and I shall not waste it.\nI have definitely become more business minded. I’ve always hated the ethos surrounding the word “entrepreneur”. When I hear that I think of a sociopathic business student who’s already rich off of old money but wants even more. I’ve been calling myself an entrepreneur, but I’ve been redefining what it means for myself. I think that I am in a unique situation where I have supporti e parents to fall back on, many close friendships, a strong intellect, my physical health and adolescence, a cesspool of ideas and passions to pursue in my head, and so much more. So mine as well try and fail than not try at all. People say to wait and plan, but that costs me invaluable time. There is no right time. As I pursue my goals I have to stay focused on myself, and I have to remind myself that this is not a selfish way to live. Because one day I am going to provide for my friends and family with the success I have. For my community at that time. I just am. I’m doing it for them. And hopefully further down the line I can have enough assets to actually make a change in this world.\nBut until that happens, I have to participate and figure out how to survive in this twisted game of green paper and digital numbers. This is also unfortunately known as “reality”.\nWish me luck.\n","date":"18 January 2024","permalink":"/blog/2024/leaving-my-job/","section":"Blog","summary":"How I\u0026rsquo;m reorientating myself, quitting my job, and my You Tube rant about it.","title":"2 weeks"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/wednesday/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Wednesday"},{"content":"12/1/2023 My YT Premiere #The YouTube video I made is premiering today at noon. I figure it may be a notable date for me in the future but honestly I don’t really care to hear what people say about this video. I’m not really proud of it in the way I’ll be proud of future videos. I made and edited this video in about an hour. I don’t really care what people think. I’m pretty apathetic about it. I’m excited to make more videos, but this one was just to get me started. It\u0026rsquo;s just me nervously talking into a camera, and I’m proud of myself for that.\nIs every other Friday a good schedule? Maybe I should make it on a weekday night. I got to talk about this with people more. I’m not a perfect person. I have a lot to say. I don\u0026rsquo;t know exactly what my videos will become. I’m just going to go with the flow to the best of my ability. A YouTube channel that’s just whatever. I think of Sam Selek and how I wish I hopped on this wave sooner.\nI think that YouTube is kind of splitting off into a literal red-pill and blue-pill place. Sam Selek and Mr. Beast are kind of the opposite ends of this spectrum I’m trying to explain. I hate that I used red-pill and blue-pill to describe it. Mr. Beast is like candy, Sam Salek is like a nice home cooked meal. I’m not saying either one of them is better than the other. I love both of them. Mr. Beast is like Times Square, and Sam Salek is like an isolative farm in Nebraska.\nContent has gotten too saturated and honestly annoying. I won’t write an essay right now. YouTube is not the same. I actually touched on this in my video, but I think we need to get back to reality. We need more videos of just people being people. And that’s what Sam Salek does well. I don’t think people are even there for the workout advice as much as they are the down to earth inspirational vibes he gives off.\nExercise is a cure all solution in my book. We weren’t meant to be sitting down all day doing little physical motion. It\u0026rsquo;s bullshit. Get the endorphins pumping. I’ve never finished a workout and felt more upset mentally than I did before. It just doesn’t happen. WE are made up of chemistry. Our bodies want to help us. The physical and mental are one in the same in a lot of ways. If you want to be better and you feel down, I guarantee you that picking up some weights, or doing cardio will change that. You have to give it a real try though. I always say that two weeks of dedication is all you need to know if it is really working or not. More often than not when I see people pick up weights, they do not put them down.\n12/6/2023 X (twitter) #No, not ecstasy. X, formerly Twitter, is a platform I thought to thoroughly revisit last night. The last time I feel like I truly dabbled with Twitter was either freshman year of college, or sometime before. I hated it then, I don’t know why I thought it would be better now. It felt like a giant filthy stew of dogshit. Featuring the best and worst of humanity, sometimes one after the other. I saw the scum of the internet. People with egos and self-images so big they probably think they are God itself. I saw devastating headlines, as well as graphic videos of pornography, violence, and death.\nI’m probably exaggerating. There are probably controls I can set on my feed so I don’t see any NSFW content. I’m glad that the freedom on the platform provides accuracy to headlines, but there was too much nonsense for me to sift through.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s made me hate myself too. Because I couldn’t look away. It was so exhilarating and tragic that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop. Fear is one of our first emotions. When we are scared or shocked to our core by news, we automatically think that it is of the most importance. Not that people dying or stuff like that is something to gloss over, but my point is that we are wired to be drawn to that. The mainstream media knows it. When there is a war or conflict that the U.S. is somewhat attached to, that’s all we will see. There is a lot of money to be made in war. And they know it. That’s why they’ll make sure it\u0026rsquo;s your favorite show. They know you’ll think it\u0026rsquo;s of the utmost importance. Again, not that it surely isn’t important, but they know you’ll be hooked. The military industrial complex will be more allowed to make more money.\nI was on X for about an hour before bed last night and I felt physically ill. I felt overwhelmed. It felt like the closest you can get to playing GTA VI without actually playing it. It’s unfiltered chaos. It’s everything that humanity has to offer in its purest form. I may return and adjust my feed, but it won’t be for a while. We are a wild species.\nThe only time I will ever use Twitter, or X, is to catch up on what Tagabow is saying. Or perhaps I’ll get sucked into crypto again. Overall, I’m scared of it, I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan but I understand its importance.\n07/02/2023 Real quick #I have X (twitter) now. So much for that rant.\n12/19/2023 Tagabow at First Unitarian Church # Full Body 2 at First Unitarian Church\nI saw one of my favorite shows to date last night. Tagabow\u0026rsquo;s last leg of tour at First Unitarian Church. A very legendary venue. Figuring out how to get in there felt like a Dark Souls map. That dude John from Julia’s War (not sure his name) tried to jip me $20. (As a joke \u0026lt;3.)\nThe two guys from SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE opened the show as their duo act called Draag Me. I believe that’s what to call them. I went hard in the pit for TAGABOW. Overall, like I said this show was one of my favorites to date. Full Body 2 was great. I met some cool people. Some of the homies from Kicker were there. Ben’s glasses got broken in the pit, but they got fixed.\nUnraveling They Are Gutting A Body Of Water\u0026rsquo;s Blissful Universe\n“You learn everything from the mirrors of other people. You learn everything through other people. Just having friends is dope, it\u0026#39;s a blessing truly.\u0026#34; ~ Douglas Dulgarian 12/21/2023 Towed #My car got towed last night yay! I parked in a handicapped spot in Chinatown. Totally my fault but the fact that I had no idea where it went, the fact that the phone number on the sign wasn’t working, and the fact that it cost me $500 to get it back has made me decide to one day destroy the Philadelphia Parking Authority.\nA quick Google search made me see that they\u0026rsquo;re a force of pure evil. They are a private entity sucking money out of the hard-working people of Philadelphia. I’m not saying I should’ve parked in that spot. What I am saying is that if I was someone else I could’ve been completely screwed.\nI never condone parking in handicapped spots. I think people who do that are awful and think they are privileged. I was being an idiot. The sign had a lot of stuff on it. I was just excited because I was on my way to a meetup.\n","date":"1 December 2023","permalink":"/blog/2023/december-backlogs/","section":"Blog","summary":"All of my December blogs rolled into one.

Because I’m seeing them tonight, so won’t I have more to say on the show until tomorrow? Am I forcing it too much?\nI’m not feeling work today at all. Transitioning from “new employee” work to “actual” work sucks for me because I’m too used to the new employee work. Getting my hand held. Having a lot of time. Having the work be easy. You feel like you need to do more. Your managers act as a panopticon making you wonder if they\u0026rsquo;re going to walk by and see you not doing work. Or see you not at your desk. Or see you writing a blog complaining about work.\nThis job has scared me straight. I try to take my time here as a lesson. A lesson to hustle when I don’t work here anymore so I never have to work in a place like this again. I’m the only one of my friends who has a salaried job with benefits out of school. I don’t realize how good I have it. I feel sick today and don’t have enough PTO to take off work. But they don’t even know what PTO is. In a figurative sense of course. I have so much free time to learn new things. I pretty much taught myself guitar theory while working here and hopefully I’ll be able to pay off my loans sooner than I thought. There are good restaurants around for lunch. Commuting is manageable. I have some former colleagues here. I made some friends here who I see everyday. None of my coworkers are bad. Work is easy. And yet…\nI want out. I feel lied to and betrayed by the system. All this extra time and work and energy into school for 16 years for me to land a random job. I didn\u0026rsquo;t need nearly 3/4 of what I learned in school to work here. Did I want this? Was this the light at the end of the tunnel? What else did I think would happen? I remember wanting a computer science degree so I can land a job and have enough time and money to do my hobbies on the side. And that’s basically what I have now. I wanted to travel more, but with my soul glued to underground music, I won’t be leaving anytime soon.\nThe thing that really gets me is something I put a higher price on everyday. And that is my time.\nWork takes my time.\nIt takes it right away from my feeble little body navigating this reality.\nExistential dread comes out of nowhere some days to push me to the ground and kick in my ribs. Make my heart ache. Make my anxiety skyrocket. Where was the class in school that addressed this daily problem? Oh, is it therapy? It\u0026rsquo;s just the fact that I don’t think my job does ANYTHING for the betterment of society and humanity as a whole.\nI could have hunted, killed, and dragged a deer back to the village so all my loved ones get to eat. I don’t even get a glimpse of the feelings I’d imagine that hunter version of me would have. My job, that I do everyday, feels completely pointless. And feeling that on a daily basis sucks.\n11/2/2023 Julie Aftermath \u0026amp; Artist Celebritisation # alantheg via IG\nWell my bandmates are inspired after seeing Julie last night. Myself included. Talk about a phenomenal upcoming band. Great original sound, original aesthetic, and cool people. I stayed late after the show. Not on purpose, I got caught up talking to some homies outside the venue. I ended up meeting the band. I talked to them a bit. Tried to get their Spotifys to stalk. I didn’t get them then and there, but I found them later. I thank their bassist, Alex, who signed my guitar pick. They told me they use the same pick for bass. My pick is somewhat thick for a guitarist I guess. I got a medium thick and sturdy pick after hearing advice from my metal guitarist friend JD. I always prefer them medium/thin and sturdy now. I almost exclusively use a 1.14mm pick.\nI can’t wait to cook.\nSomething funny and something I still don\u0026rsquo;t know how to deal with regarding the underground scene is that my favorite bands, my favorite artists, are often standing next to me in the crowd. Standing side by side at the urinals. They’re at the same show as me. It sounds stupid, I know they’re just people like me, but sometimes I can’t help but celebritize them. It’s something I’m working on. I try my absolute hardest to stay calm and talk to them like I met them on the street. Because that’s how people should be treated of course, how any new person should be treated. On a normal interaction I’m kind, courteous, and curious to people I meet for the first time. With all these upcoming artists around me I sometimes struggle not to be an absolute fanboy and act standoffish. I got some growing up to do…\nWhen you’re so deep into an artistic medium you develop an appreciation for new artists in the scene that you find and like. And you can become obsessive. Or at least I can. In a way, a lot of the time, it\u0026rsquo;s almost like the art is personified in the human being that made it. Talking to the musician who made a song is like talking to the song itself. You’re talking to its conjurer. We’re all little Gods whenever we create stuff, and it’s fucking cool.\nTalking to the members of Julie I think, “It\u0026rsquo;s so late, they’re touring, hauling all their equipment to put away, probably trying to get out of the venue asap so they can get some sleep before the highway wakes them up.” I assume a;; that. I could probably ask, “Hey I’m a big fan and I know it\u0026rsquo;s late, could you chat for a few minutes?” Then it\u0026rsquo;s on them if they decide to talk to me. But those rational or \u0026ldquo;natural\u0026rdquo; thoughts have yet to stay present in those moments. Am I being rational? Or am I just not being confident? Am I forcing my presence on someone, or is their no playbook here? You have to be careful with that word “should”. Everybody is different.\nI’ve absorbed so much music and talked to so many artists. I figure, let them come to me.\n“No matter how isolated you are and how lonely you feel, if you do your work truly and conscientiously, unknown friends will come and seek you.” ~ Carl Jung I would really like to talk to Tyler, the Creator one day. But at this point in my life, I don’t think it would be right if I did? That’s like selling out Wells Fargo when you only wrote one song. It doesn’t feel right. He is a walking goat, what do I have to show for it? Not that I am of less worth, but I feel I need a history of music, music videos, and/or other art to show for myself. I don’t like that I gate keep myself. No one ever should. I think the point I was getting to is that if you want to talk to your idols make yourself feel certain that they would want to talk to you.\n11/3/2023 The Creative Process Heals #I always have so much to say. Starting this blog has made me realize how much I have to say, and how I can effectively talk to myself. Writing out your thoughts will reveal all to you. Everything in your mind put onto paper is indisputable.\nI had a talk with my friend Joycie last night about life and creativity. I wish I could see him more. We both work a lot, usually opposite schedules. He works at concert venues. I could write a novel about my beautiful friendship with him that has lasted since kindergarten when I was jealous of the clear tray he had in class. (Most of the students in the class had a black tray, for papers and whatnot, but he had a clear one.) Now, 16 years later, we are best friends. He lets my band practice in his basement. I’ll gladly gas him up anytime.\nAnyways we talked about how the creative process evolves and heals you as a person. How being an artist is therapeutic. I don’t know the psychology as to why creation is healing, and I will not look it up so I don\u0026rsquo;t psyche myself out. We talked about Tyler, the Creator and Action Bronson and Dave Grohl and what they all have in common. A couple things I’ll list below:\nThey have started unapologetically doing what they want and liking what they like from a young age. They are passionate about everything in every moment, not just about the mediums they’ve found success in. They are grateful for life. They are completely themselves all the time. They have a large support system around them. They have great relationships with their mothers, and the women in their life. Joycie praised and showed gratitude for all the women in his life. I’m glad I’m going home to see my mom today.\nLater thoughts\u0026hellip;\nI had some things to say about High School when I finished this blog post. Probably because it relates to the rest. Now that college is finished, High School seems even more like a dream. I have very strange reactions when I think of some high school memories. I think it comes from over romanticizing it, nostalgia, pain, and feeling like it was another life. Because it kind of was for me, even though that sounds dramatic.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s just so surreal sometimes.\n11/5/2023 Charles Library #Working in the Charles Library because I’m trying to remember what it\u0026rsquo;s like to be a college student. Just kidding… but walking around campus is bittersweet. It\u0026rsquo;s crazy how much of a different person I am with a different mindset compared to last May when I was graduating. A lot can happen in a year.\nI thought that once I got out of college I would have no more excuses for myself. At that point it\u0026rsquo;s just me vs. myself. Nothing is going to get in the way of what I want to do. In school the stress of grades and assignments meant it didn’t matter that I had more free time. I had so much free time. And so many times I’d be tired and unproductive. Stress and anxiety and all that jazz.\nCleaning up my computer and iPhone right now. Doing that once in a while clears your head. I think it\u0026rsquo;s always good to clean before doing a more mentally exhaustive task. It’s like warming up for sports.\nWe’re working on the demos later. I have to finish up the Stoop documentary and my personal website. I might work at the Met.\n11/6/2023 Pixies #I’ve been listening to Doolittle. That album is divine. It’s like candy to my music mind. It\u0026rsquo;s so emotional and fun. It just is. Very inspiring. I’d love to sound like Black Francis. The songs are so layered and deep that I’m not getting sick of them. They have such a November vibe.\nDimmer is trying to get our shit together so we can have new songs ready for the show December 2nd with the Monks. Or at least that’s what’s getting set up right now. Our friend Matt Perkins will hopefully play with us in his band “Cats on Mushrooms”. Name never gets old. I’m dying to play a show off campus at Temple. It\u0026rsquo;s a big reason I stuck around the university. Much to my dad’s objections.\nI don’t know how to lower my expectations of life right now. I have big dreams and I’m trying to achieve them. I’m trying to find an alternative to the job I have. But will I miss the present moment too much trying to pursue this creative and financial freedom? Escaping the matrix doesn’t exactly mean financial freedom to me. Although I’m not saying that wouldn’t help. Escaping the matrix is just enjoying your life and having enough time to pursue your hobbies. Enough time that you’re satisfied with. Maybe I’m still just desperate to feel special, before this monkey’s gone to heaven.\nI want to convey all these weird and magical and strange and complex feelings I’ve had throughout my life. I don’t want to feel alone, I don’t want others to be too. I want to relate. A lot of these feelings contain a lot of weight from mere existence itself, and they probably arise from the times I felt like I was the actual center of the universe. It\u0026rsquo;s powerful. The desire to express yourself becomes overwhelming when you realize you can go at any moment. That\u0026rsquo;s what I think and feel.\n11/7/2023 Stress # gelehaas via Pinterest\nYou ever get so stressed and worried that it physically hurts. Your brain can’t even think straight. You can’t even find a rational solution. You figure out how you’re going to deal with your problems, but your conscience still wants to worry. You tell yourself like “Okay, when the time comes we’re going to do this.” And then it\u0026rsquo;s settled, it\u0026rsquo;s done. You decided what you’re going to do; what the best thing to do is. But still, your mind and body don\u0026rsquo;t have it. It\u0026rsquo;s still on alert. It is still stressed. You’re in panic mode. Just waiting for time to pass when the stress will inevitably go away.\nI’m going back to therapy. I really need it atm. I decided it was time before this stress after I had yet another existential crisis on vacation. Sometimes I feel this world isn’t made for us.\nSomething that’s been messing with me lately is how we all just “think” we are alive. We think we\u0026rsquo;re special and things are things but they’re not. Everything we see we just name. We’re just assigning specific sounds to things. All the parts of our anatomy aren’t actually what we call them. That’s not their name. We named them, and we’re not real. We just think we are. Am I making sense? Maybe not. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s too nard to convery.\nHow do we know this is the highest reality? Isn’t everything just an abstraction? Maybe we’re simulated. I think there is a lot of evidence to support that. Maybe God is trying to run simulations in the hopes of making another God to hang out with. I’m glad our bodies are resilient, for most of us…\n\u0026#34;The universe is a cruel, uncaring void. The key to being happy isn\u0026#39;t a search for meaning. It\u0026#39;s to just keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense, and eventually, you\u0026#39;ll be dead.\u0026#34; ~ Mr. Peanutbutter 11/8/2023 Elan School \u0026amp; Dave Grohl #I made a resume today. For a security position at a local venue. The Met. If I get hired I get to just stand there and hear live music for free. And I get paid to do it!? Sounds like a win win to me. My friend Joycie works at the Mann center. He swears on it being the best job of all time, or one of them. Experiences are priceless. They’re moments in time that you’re paying for. You’re paying to be present at a certain spot in space and time? I’d kill to work at music venues with the salary I do now. I don’t think that will ever happen though. I guess I’ll keep you posted. If you’re reading this… Why are you reading this?\nElan School:\nI finished elan school. Elan.school is a masterpiece, but I don’t think it\u0026rsquo;s right to call it that. Not that it isn’t a “masterpiece”, but it\u0026rsquo;s a story the creator never asked for. At least at the start of it. He wasn’t making this webcomic, graphic novel based on a fictional character that he feeds his own experience into. This was his experience. It\u0026rsquo;s an autobiography. And it just so happens to be one of the most incredible stories I’ve ever heard. It\u0026rsquo;s real. Do you know what the means?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s weird to feel like you know someone so intimately, yet never having met them. In Joe Nobody’s case (the creator of elan.school), I’ve never even seen his face. If I ever saw him though I think I’d actually break down and sob. And I don’t think he’d even be weirded out by it. I think he’d get it. If I’m not making sense I don’t blame you. I’m not going to attempt to describe the story. Just go read it. I will be worth your time. It will inspire you, and I think that’s something the creator would love to provide.\nDave Grohl:\nThe only other person I feel like I have that deep connection with despite never meeting them is Dave Grohl. I was already fond of his music, but after reading his biography, The Storyteller, I realized I made a friend. This dude is someone who rocks, and I know that I will meet him one day. The universe has let me know, trust me. Don’t judge a book by its cover though, right? They say, “Don’t meet your idols”. Well in this case I read the book. He is the only person who I’ve taken a liking to their music and read their autobiography. Th only exception is Will Smith. I read his autobiography right before the infamous slap. (That was so surreal you have no idea.) Anyways Dave Grohl deserves all the hype for being true to himself and being genuine. He’s the biggest rockstar to me, even if he’s not topping the charts all the time. Even though he still is haha.\nAlex G’s album DSU is becoming my favorite album of his.\n11/9/2023 Waveform \u0026amp; Wallace, Tonight # Juliette Boulay via bornloser.org\nHoly crap! Should I curse here? I’m going to try and omit profanity from this blog. Anyways, I love Waveform holy crap they’re so good. Just go listen. The articles I’ve read have articulated very well the emotions their music invokes, but I am also being lazy at the moment. They’re signed to Run For Cover Records. I love so many of the other artists/bands signed to that label. Horse Jumper of Love, Turnover, Wicca Phase Springs Eternal… I’d love to sign to a label with an ethos like Run for Cover one day, but until then we’re independent as fuck. I think my bandmates would ultimately want to sign to Juliaswar, who I’m not opposed to. I’m getting ahead of myself though. We got to release music first. We got a lot of stuff to do first.\nDimmer Stuff:\nJeff was thinking of releasing some sinppets on Soundcloud. This way people can hear what we sound like. Other than that I don’t think we will be releasing music for a while. We have 4 songs pretty much done at the moment that we like. Two other ones that are also done but we don’t like. We have a song in 6/8 time that Jeff isn’t feeling. I love it though because I think my vocals shine, and it is rhythmically different for obvious reasons. Our band functions as a democracy best it can. So there you have it. Our secret is out. We are a democratic band. (Dimmer is our band btw.)\nMaybe I really could start writing a book. I have so much I want to talk about. I know it\u0026rsquo;s cringe to care about stuff but bear with me oh wise Buddha. Maybe I shouldn’t talk about stuff because if I get it all out of me in words, I won’t want to get it out of me so much in music anymore.\nI\u0026rsquo;m kidding. People on the internet are often bad with humor and sarcasm. I think sometimes they’re crazy, and sometimes stuff gets lost in translation. I used to think emojis were cringey for a long time but the fact is they’re super helpful. Our expressions and tones when we talk, all the little subtleties can change the context of something that is said. Like how you think I’m yelling right now! Wow, I’m such a David Foster Wallace genius over here talking about punctuation and being emotive in conversations!\nWallace, Tonight:\nFear and Loathing with Wallace this Friday! John sent me more Wallace, Tonight recordings and demos. Thanks for the leaks, they are so very good. The members of Wallace, Tonight are all masterful at what they do. I love Paul’s vocals a lot. Am I supposed to have been given those demos? Guys if you see this, don’t get mad at John. I won’t share it with anyone. The last of the three EPs is probably out by the time you’re reading this anyways.\n11/16/2023 Love those you love #“Memento Mori” is a latin phrase that I really live by. It means “remember you will die”. It sounds morbid at first. I found it because it was the slogan of the Austere Academy that the Baudelaire children stay at in the 5th book of Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events. What else would it be with an author like that guy?\nYou’re going to die. I always say death is the most neutral thing possible. “Oh no, there’s nothing after death!” Who told you that \u0026ldquo;nothing\u0026rdquo; is bad? Nothing is nothing. It is perfectly gray. That’s not the point. I think for most of my life, I spent it not realizing that everything I see is made up. Not that reality isn’t real, but that everything we have isn’t a given. We don’t stop to contemplate about how much of our abilities aren’t a given. It feels like language is a given. It feels like food and water and shelter is a given. Often times our friends and health. I know it\u0026rsquo;s not the same for everyone, some people are dealt a bad hand that introduces them to reality at a young age, but some people go through their whole life completely blue-pilled.\nNot realizing that everything is a construct is bad for business. In a spiritual sense. Do you realize that all the math ever made can be chalked up to some wierd drawings. Or that language can just be called “specific noises”. Everything we experience in our head is stored in our biological computer. That’s where the world actually is in a sense. I’m sure you’ve heard a lot of this before. This wasn’t even the rant I thought I’d go on about with “memento mori”, but its important to remember.\nMotivational speech time. Make sure to buy my course after this.\nYou have one life. One body. If you lose an arm, it\u0026rsquo;s gone forever. Or at least it\u0026rsquo;s not coming back the same way. So appreciate it now. Appreciate the years behind you and go all in on the bet that you’ll be around for years to come. Because life is not short. Life is long. Very long. And it\u0026rsquo;s not going to be easy. Take charge of your life now before it\u0026rsquo;s too late. Do not get complacent. Do not get passive. Do not ever think you have to stay where you are, and not surpass the bar set by the tribe around you. Inspire others. You’re going to die. Don’t you want to live up to a legacy you’re proud of?\nDo stuff. Stay busy. Otherwise, what else is there to do? It\u0026rsquo;s funny how boredom exists. Everything is an abstraction. We are in a simulation. Wake up. Have gratitude. Be a little schizo. Be a little delusional. It can do some good sometimes.\n11/20/2023 Almost Turkey Day # Wild Red via IG\nIs it a bit much to title my daily blog posts? I think it\u0026rsquo;s too late for me to go back now so you’re going to have to deal with it. I’ll probably blog more when I have more time.\nThis morning I listened to “2008” by ericadoa and “Little Girl” by Dangermouse and Julian Casablancas. They were recommended by the members of Waveform in an interview. Or not recommended exactly, but they said that those were those favorite songs at that moment. Maybe for that year? I’m not sure, I just wrote those songs down on sticky notes 2 weeks ago. Also “How to Be Kind” by Fish Hunt. They’re all great. I love hyperpop and Julian Casablancas so it was a nice surprise.\nHere is some lore. I’m from Scranton and my old roommates are too, although a different part of it. Their friend from highschool at the time I’m writing this is dating a dude named Rylan, who is the brother of a dude named Jonah, who is playing bass in the band Hot Mulligan. This is all public information I swear. They’re in the pop punk niche. They play in the band Wild Red along with the guitarist from 10 Sluggz. His name is Dan and he plays drums for them. I don’t know how they practice because of time and locations, but anyways I met him and Jonah briefly. I talked to Dan about the music video he shot for Soul Glo. It was “Gold Chain Punk”. I want to make more music videos. I’ve known Rylan for some time actually. He introduced me to Jonah outside of Bonk’s Bar where Wild Red had a gig with Florida band \u0026ldquo;getwiththis\u0026rdquo;. Wild Red is from a town near Wilkes-Barre which was the stomping ground of another little band I like called Title Fight. I annoyingly talked about Title Fight too much. They’re both nice guys who have a great appreciation for the craft. I thought about getting a show together back in Scranton once Hot Mulligan is done touring.\nDimmer Update:\nAt the time of writing Dimmer has 5 songs that we see as adequate to play. They are all demos, and demos are demos, but I mean it just makes me so happy that we’ve come this far. Hopefully we can get people something they can chew on. We have a couple of other songs on the backburner that we may flush out. Songwriting has been a very interesting process and we’re still figuring it out. Thank God for Google Drive and Garageband.\nI’m going to leave my job to do dropshipping and get rich quick schemes.\n11/27/2023 Your Pain Is Mine Now #I have my first string of YouTube videos set to upload this Friday at noon. Two of them are already out there. They’re fan made music videos. The other one is called “Just Start” and it\u0026rsquo;s a shitty video. But that is the point of it. I had to get out of my own way and just start on the path to making videos. And over time I will get better and better at them and their quality will keep getting better.\nIn my personal life I am dealing with a lot right now. It\u0026rsquo;s very stressful. I’ve never dealt with stress like this to be honest. I can only describe the feeling as this, “knowing I have to fire someone and I have to do it soon”. All this stuff I can’t worry about because I have to practice! Our gig is literally this Saturday.\nThe stress. It\u0026rsquo;s my job. Its relationships. It\u0026rsquo;s my friends. It\u0026rsquo;s my family. It\u0026rsquo;s the future. It\u0026rsquo;s the past. It\u0026rsquo;s my perception of myself. It\u0026rsquo;s being uncomfortable with the fact that nothing is promised. I hate driving cars. I listened to Floral Green today.\n11/28/203 Finding Car Seat Headrest # Everette True via everetttest\nI am so tired today in my little cubicle. I think my roommate keeps turning the heat off because he likes to sleep in the cold. I get it, it feels more snug, but I gotta get up for work!\nI’m very excited for our show coming up, it should go over very well. It\u0026rsquo;s at a kid’s apartment called the Monastery and the Monks are opening. It’s the Monks’ apartment. They do covers of the Strokes and Arctic Monkeys. Cats on Mushrooms is also playing. I love and miss my boy Matt Perkins. A true music man he is. I would walk home and see him practicing for the drumline on Geasey field. It was right across from my apartment at the time. He was in Temple’s band. But before that he was in my Data Structures and Algorithms class. That was where we bonded and shared our love for music. He would also laugh at me because I would accidentally touch his laptop screen and be amazed that it’s a touch screen. (He laughed because it happened like 6 times.) He showed me Car Seat Headrest and LCD Soundsystem. Which to my knowledge are his two favorite bands of all time. I think he likes LCD more though. I saw Car Seat Headrest with him. It\u0026rsquo;s a funny story.\nMy junior year of college I threw on Twin Fantasy while doing homework. Little did I know it would make me cry. I couldn’t hold back the tears when I heard those lyrics and those choruses. Pure emotion was oozing out of the lead singer who I didn’t even investigate yet. I remember Bodys came on and the line came where he cries and pleads. “Don’t you realize our bodies can fall apart at any second?”. I was in love with Car Seat Headrest after that moment. Them and Black Country New Road really defined that year for me. LCD too. I was able to face pent up emotions more and more. That was also the time where Mike started expanding my world of music as well.\nI could write an essay on Car Seat Headrest. It\u0026rsquo;s very good and very gay. This band came into my life at the perfect time when I needed those words and those emotions. I don’t know if it\u0026rsquo;s a gay thing, but there is something about the emotions Will displays that feel ethereal. (Isaac Wood\u0026rsquo;s as well.) I get it. I felt less alone. I felt like my feelings were being articulated in their music with a real perfection I had yet to discover. It was so utterly raw, and I realized that being honest with yourself and your emotions, expressing them in magical ways, letting go of ego, doing what you want, was more badass than acting like your some masculine blue-pilled zombie. I hope that makes sense.\nI realized that I highly valued people who did what they liked no matter what others think. Expressing yourself is the way to be. I broke my old mindset. I used to think that a drag show queen was obviously less masculine than a UFC fighter. Something else made me think that. Any time spent worrying about if you look too feminine or too masculine is an absolute waste. Look up Diego Garijo. There’s no rules. You’re not what people view you as, you’re what you know you are. Just be yourself. Define yourself for yourself.\nWill Toledo did not hold back. It made me realize that I was. And I need to start really trying to stop that.\nI didn’t buy a ticket to see Car Seat Headrest because I knew the universe would make me see them. And it did. Matt miraculously had an extra ticket the day or so before the show and we went. That’s where I met Merr too. Right now they are the drummer for the Vatican City Missile Crisis. I think we\u0026rsquo;ll all go far.\n","date":"1 November 2023","permalink":"/blog/2023/november-backlogs/","section":"Blog","summary":"All my November blogs rolled into one.

Right now I’m writing on a Google doc. I don’t have a place where I’m hosting and sharing this blog for all to see yet, but I will soon. You would think I would have thought about starting a blog for a long time, but it\u0026rsquo;s actually quite the contrary. So far, a blog has been a fleeting idea in my life, however I have a lot of confidence that this will be great for me, and I’ll remain consistent. I already consistently journal everyday with paper and pencil, although that does come in phases. I started getting very consistent with it because I have a lot of time at my current office job and if I was going to go crazy working here I was sure as hell going to document it.\nBefore that I was journaling most nights for therapeutic purposes. Months and months and months. I have entire books. It helps me, and I bet it would help you. (If you don\u0026rsquo;t do it already.) I won’t get into the psychology of it. The only difference now is that it\u0026rsquo;s for the public to see. Am I going to omit certain things since this is public? Yes\u0026hellip; however, I’m going to try my best to not do that. To an extent. That extent being what intuitivety feel to not say. I\u0026rsquo;ll try my best to not hold back, besides obvious things like the numbers on the back of my credit card.\nI want to be authentic and personable here because I don’t think enough people are. I think it\u0026rsquo;s time for my writing to be shared with the world. It\u0026rsquo;s one of the greatest gifts we have as humans.\nThere are a lot of people I look up to who are just everyday people. People in my life. Being with them gives me the same feeling I think I’d get if I’m ever hanging with one of my idols who are very famous and successful. I get very curious about their thoughts, their daily life, what they think about, etc. Mostly in the context of how they go about creating their music and art, or how they go about their craft, whatever it may be. I just want to pick their brain over and over and over again. I’ve been obsessed with interviews and sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s hard to find stuff like that. So maybe I can start a trend. Everybody blogs. Maybe my brain will be the one someone wants to pick one day? If they’re crazy enough. And then they’ll have this. Regardless I’m doing this for myself to a degree. Its for myself and the reader, but I am unapologetically talk about all the stuff I’m nerdy about and life in general.\nI have way too many thoughts that my body gets upset about. I think I can alleviate this symptom by getting thoughts on paper and screens. Curiosities finally shared. That’s what I realized being an artist and a musician is about for myself. It conveys those thoughts and feelings in a way that isn’t boring. In a way where someone can understand it more than words can say. Simply put, it just works. It just feels better to express. So sorry if you don’t like how I express myself. Or if it makes you uncomfortable. I guess maybe I’m doing it for selfish reasons.\nWords still say a lot. Words are just one medium of expression, and can do a lot. I mean I’d argue that the invention of language is the biggest reason we conquered nature and got to where we are now as a species. But there is indeed far more than language.\nI’m so damn excited for this blog. I can already feel that it\u0026rsquo;s been 2Long. We’re going to get INTO IT here. Philadelphia is my kryptonite in a good way.\n10/30/2023 Noise # Mitchell Jorstad via X (Twitter)\nIn my office at my desk there is this terrible noise ringing above my head from the rumbling of the central air system. It\u0026rsquo;s very annoying, and not exciting to hear about I’m sure, but I figured Nardwaur could ask me about it one day. And I’ll say, “yeah, that was annoying”.\nThoughts like these make me realize that I really am crazy enough to envision a future like that where I’m living my dreams. Or what I mean is I’m crazy enough to think I can achieve them. However I often ask myself, “what else is there to do?”. I imagine one day I’ll find the right person, or people, and I’ll settle down somewhere. Somewhere pretty and quiet and I’ll just exist. It’ll be like changing from survival to peaceful mode. Hopefully I figure out how I can make money online, or all corporations just finally let us work from home. Whatever works, as long as it works. I’m so completely sick of the hustling and bustling of the eastern seaboard. The highways, and fast food, and office buildings, and industrial parks, and more. I am so sick of. I can see why it\u0026rsquo;s an economic powerhouse of the modern world. It\u0026rsquo;s a machine that doesn’t stop running. It runs on human lives. It won’t have mine.\nDo I need to relax? I think becoming relaxed too early is what dooms most.\n10/31/2023 Adventure Time # (Me as Finn the Human at Chapter House on Halloween, Mikey baby got sick. I remeber people kept going in Ben\u0026rsquo;s room so he was taping it shut.)\nI am dressed up as Finn from Adventure Time today for our company’s costume contest. My two friends here are Marceline and PB respectively.\nRight now I feel pretty trapped in this job. I don’t feel like I have as much going for me as I would like to. All I know is it\u0026rsquo;s good to save money right now. By now I wanted to finish the documentary for the Philadelphia Stoop venue. I wanted to have my personal website up. I wanted my personal song “Kenopsia” and accompanying music video to be out. I still haven’t gotten access to Adobe creative cloud. I’m going to ask one of my friends who still goes to Temple to let me use their account since it\u0026rsquo;s $100. At this point maybe I should just give into the annual subscription if I’m going to be all in anyway. I finished editing a YouTube video though. And I guess starting this blog is progress too. I need better internet in my house goddammit. I need that ethernet outlet dawg. Like please, I’m begging you. My PC can’t handle shitty Wi-Fi. I should just buy a Mac.\nWhen I get home I need to rest because I will NOT miss Julie at the Ukie Club. I am coming down with a cold atm and I’m not too pleased about it. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s because I’ve been going to the gym too much. I doubt they clean those machines thoroughly. I cannot miss that show. I just simply refuse to. It\u0026rsquo;s nothing but water and sleep when I get home. Tunaween is tonight with Friend and Wallace, Tonight and Disaster Artist. I don’t think I’m going to make it. I’m going to take some extra strength cold and flu or whatever the hell big pharma nonsense that will help me.\nJulie is a band that I look up to a lot. I aspire to be like them with my art and music in so many ways. They are probably my top 5 modern bands right now. Class acts in whatever the hell you want to group them as. I think they’re aggressive but soft. They’re visceral and aesthetic. They definitely nailed their aesthetic. I love them. I’ll shut up now.\nMaybe I’m not as good at blogging as I think I am?
