Why Did I Pick Up This Book? #I don’t read very habitually, but I do tend to read novels from time to time. It’s better than an iPhone screen before bedtime. My roommate, who is a far different breed, can get through multiple books a week. That\u0026rsquo;s the goal one day.\nThis was my first time with Dostoyevsky, and the honest reason I decided to pick up and read Crime \u0026amp; Punishment was simply because I heard it was one of those must-read-before-you-die pieces of literature. It is an English teacher’s favorite. I’ve read other books in a similar vein such as 1984 and Brave New World and I had some ideas of what those books were about before I read them. I had little to no idea what this book was about, and although 1984 was utterly disturbing, nothing could have prepared me for the journey which is Crime \u0026amp; Punishment.\nAm I being dramatic enough?\nAll I knew was that it was a fictional novel that takes place in 19th century Russia. I heard about it because Jordan Peterson praised Dostoyevsky often. I was never very fond of Mr. Peterson’s political theory, but I have gotten a lot of value out of his insights with psychology and theology. And this book is surely a study of the human psyche, told through its many characters and plots.\nVery quickly, I must mention that I wish Dr. Peterson stayed in his lane… Being a Jordan Peterson fan is enough to get someone cancelled nowadays, so let me just say that I think he has made too many mistakes and unsavory remarks, especially in his more recent career, for me to consider myself a fan.\nAnyways, as I said, I went into this book blind. So there I was, at Washington Square on a beautiful sunny day, sitting under a tree, and reading away, until suddenly I’m feasting my mind’s eye on the graphic depiction of our protagonist committing a violent axe murder.\nYeah, it is that dramatic. Thanks for the mental scars Fyodor.\n“Oh my good God!” I say to myself as I nervously laugh. What did I just get myself into? How am I supposed to read another 400 pages of this story following a protagonist who is now a gruesome murderer? I found myself repulsed by his character and I wanted nothing to do with him.\nThis book was not easy to read, and I put it down for a while after reading the particular chapter with the murder. It was difficult due to its depressing themes and atmosphere, and also the lengthy and complex literature. I ask myself as I write this blog if perhaps I wanted to read this book to satisfy some stupid inner ego. To challenge myself.\nThe truth is that Crime \u0026amp; Punishment is the exact novel the main protagonist Raskolinkov would seek out to read, and I hated the way in which this book held up a mirror to myself. This is why I want to discuss it with myself out loud. I am very glad I read it, especially at this time in my life. I think you’ll see why soon.\nLet’s Get Into It #First, right off the bat, the main character of the story, Rodion Romanovich or “Raskolnikov”, has a lot of similarities to me and my own life. He’s 23 years old, an ex-university student, above average height, living alone, in a big city, and he wishes to make money to support his family although he can’t seem to bring himself to sustain a job. He’s suffocated by his own intellectualism and blinded by his pride and genius. On a dime he will fluctuate from being extremely altruistic to completely apathetic. He is depressed and neurotic as well, even before he committed the murders.\nAm I saying I’m an exact copy of him? No. But if it wasn’t obvious by me writing all this, I have given into the fact that I related and felt for his character very much.\nHe gets the idea to murder a pawnbroker woman who is described as an old hag nobody in town likes. She’s known as greedy and rude. Raskolnikov’s idea is to kill her while she’s home alone, take her rubles and valuables, and use the money to finance himself to finish school and help his impoverished family. I also believe he wanted to start a law practice business as that was what he was studying at university.\nIn the book, it says that he saw himself as a “Napoleon”, some great champion and leader, like the actual Napoleon Bonaparte or Alexander the Great. He saw himself as equal to these individuals. Someone who wouldn\u0026rsquo;t hesitate for a moment to carry out a heinous deed if it meant the betterment of humanity. Even murder.\nRaskolnikov sees killing this pawnbroker woman as just that. He can save the world if he carries out this one simple atrocious act. He doesn’t think moral codes apply to individuals like himself. So, caught up in these superstitions of himself and the world that brewed inside his miserable isolation, he goes through with the murder (unfortunately he has to kill another innocent witness during it), and quickly realizes that killing these people also causes him to kill himself. He becomes mentally martyred. His old mind and his old self is gone forever. Blinded by pride and ego he doesn\u0026rsquo;t take into account how this experience would affect him.\nSaying he was out of his depth can’t even begin to describe it. He hides the little money he manages to steal, (he doesn’t steal much because he panics) and doesn’t even use it out of immediate guilt. The rest of the novel is spent following him through his new inner insanity and ultimate redemption. It follows other complex characters too, some who I’ll mention later. From what I’ve gathered online, it appears that everyone understands to a large degree why Raskolnikov decided to carry out the murder and that by the end, after pleading guilty, going to prison, and devoting his life to the love of his life and to God, he is completely redeemed.\nSuperman #If you follow this blog you know it\u0026rsquo;s been a little while, and you also know that my last blog post was about Luigi Mangione. I am very thankful for Dostoyevsky for showing us that any act of cold blooded murder, no matter a supposed justification, means that one is playing God. A role only fit for nature itself. Although we humans are nature, I believe that our highly developed consciousness has separated us from it. In the words of Rust Cohle:\nI think human consciousness is a tragic misstep in human evolution. We became too self aware; nature created an aspect of nature separate from itself. We are creatures that should not exist by natural law. We are things that labor under the illusion of having a self, a secretion of sensory experience and feeling, programmed with total assurance that we are each somebody, when in fact everybody’s nobody.\nI imagine that those carrying out war crimes are either psychopaths or have died figuratively as well. Does the hope for redemption mean we must do everything we can to capture and rehabilitate the war mongers of the world, or are they themselves the evils of Pandora’s Box that must be dealt with before we can see the hope?\nI want to admit a recurring fantasy I often have. I sometimes think of creating a graphic novel out of it, to turn it into something constructive, but often I just scoff at myself for having this fantasy at all. Maybe fantasy isn\u0026rsquo;t the right word for it, but its a daydream of a reality where I suddenly gain the abilities of Superman.\nThis part of my imagination is certainly fueled by my love for the show The Boys. With these new superhuman abilities I immediately fly and crash through the ceilings of the major government buildings of Washington D.C. The city’s defensive missiles bouncing off of me like nothing. I softly touch the ground and demand the politicians and lobbyists to tell the public the truth. I demand they tell me who is acting the most sinister. I demand they tell me who is blackmailing who. I give the U.S. and many powerful countries of the world deadlines to better their societies. To end wealth inequality, to have free healthcare, to prioritize quality of life and education…\nIn this fantasy I usually seen myself as the good-hearted Superman, but I’m actually being a terrorist. I think I’m Daenerys Targaryen, liberating the world, demanding what I think should be improved with the threat of dragon fire. Would I really go through with hurting or even killing world leaders if they didn’t do what I wanted? Would I destroy precious infrastructure? Does obtaining the powers of Superman mean I now have the responsibility to use them for something like this?\nIn the comics, Superman doesn’t get involved with world affairs, he just saves it from obvious things that cause it assured destruction. In Man of Steel (2013), Superman never once intentionally kills anyone, friend or foe, until Zod has an innocent family cornered. We think of ourselves as Superman, but perhaps Alan Moore was right in suggesting that we’d be more like Homelander. Emotional. Erratic. Overconfident.\nHuman.\nDo I know for sure that threatening a President with my glowing red laser beams will make the world a better place?\nI now realize what that movie superhero movie Sky High was trying to say with its lesson:\nJust because you have powers doesn’t make you a hero.\nI can\u0026rsquo;t believe I\u0026rsquo;m quoting that movie.\nPerhaps this blog is ultimately for those who do happen to have the most power. Too bad it\u0026rsquo;s unlikely those individuals will ever read it.\nI realize now that if everyone thought they are righteous to transcend humanity’s collective morals then we would quickly have a world of anarchy. Do I think murder can’t be justified? The Christian Bible allows “killing”, if another person is trying to murder you or someone else, but the butterfly effect of doing that is long and impossible to predict. All I know is that I am empathetic towards those like Raskolnikov and Luigi, (although Luigi hasn’t been officially convicted of murder) because what matters to me is the positive change I believe they had hoped would come about from their vile actions.\nThe Bloody Mirror #We have all entertained ourselves at some point in time with the thoughts of killing someone. Children play games all the time where they fight one another and act out dramatic deaths. It\u0026rsquo;s in our nature. It’s in our games, movies, books, and news. Ask yourself, at what point in our imagination does violent entertainment turn into violent considerations? I think society sees violent thoughts as nothing but intrusive thoughts until an actual murder is committed. By this logic you’re either at a 0 or a 100. This leaves all the responsibility on the individual to decide when to seek help for themselves if their mind is unwell.\nListen, I’m not talking about thoughts of killing someone because you’re a demented serial killer or have a sick fetish. I’m not making a point here on serial killer psychology.\nI’m talking about thoughts where you think if you killed the right person or people, at the right time, that it would benefit humanity at large. Exactly like Raskolnikov thought. If you “entertain” the idea of doing it, should that be considered a crime to be punished? I think if the government could read our thoughts they would very much punish it.\nHave you ever thought about going back in time and killing Hitler? If you’ve never thought about killing the right person for the sake of others, ask yourself this:\nIf you were given a button which when pressed would immediately and painlessly kill Vladamir Putin would you press it? What about all the heads of Mexico\u0026rsquo;s drug cartels? How about a U.S. President? Has this hypothetical ever crossed your mind? Would you press the button for any of them? Would you dare to be God?\nIt might be in our nature to become God if given the option. How arrogant of a species.\nI guess it\u0026rsquo;s been long overdue for me to watch Death Note.\nBack To The Book #Determining if someone is truly altruistic in their core, even if their actions are morally wrong, is a decision we all get to make within ourselves. I find it to be a determination we come to on a spiritual level. Of course I take into account what someone did on paper, but I look deeper as to what they meant to get out of it. What they wanted to start, or maybe what they’d hope to end. I never examine them by facts alone. I look into their eyes, I see what art they’ve shared, I learn about how they grew up, I try to feel what they have been going through.\nThere is a cathartic moment in the book when Raskolnikov confesses his crime to a girl named Sonya, a person made of selfless love for her family and others. In an even worse financial situation, she never once thinks about murder or even stealing.\nIf I were to be in the room with them when he confessed, I know I would have consoled him. I’d console a murderer, because through the inner monologues the author depicts, I found myself in him. I felt bad that his mind went where it did. I’d direct him towards the hope at the bottom of the dreadful box he opened.\nI might be getting long winded. This book is the best depiction of criminal psychology I’ve ever read. It’s a great testament against nihilism and how one needs God in their life. (Not the Christian God specifically, but true faith in the idea of one.)\nThe conclusion I’ve come to with this novel is simply to be more like Razumikhin and less like Raskolnikov.\nRazumikhin is the foil character to Raskolnikov and follows him a great deal throughout the story. He’s a bubbly, cheerful optimist who although oblivious at times never goes into the realm of doomed ignorance. He can be annoying, but he’s always himself. He is struggling financially very similarly to Raskolnikov, but he doesn’t decide to kill an old pawnbroker because of it. He always tries to find logical conclusions and never assumes he’s being deceived or shown a false narrative. He is the least suspicious of Raskolnikov despite being with him the most and witnessing his maddening behavior. Out of all the characters, I feel that Razumikhin understood Raskolnikov the least because he can’t imagine someone being anything other than themselves, or living a lie.\nI hate that just “being positive” time and time again is demonstrated to be so effective.\nI fear that I know far too well how to be someone I’m not. I know far too well how to be like Raskolnikov. So this blog was a curious dissection, but also a confession of sorts.\nConclusion #I know exactly how to isolate myself and brood over absolutely fucking everything. Dooming myself and the entire world before I’ve even given myself or the world a chance. I’m 23 years old and I’m already being ageist towards myself in the things I want to pursue. I have been largely unemployed for the past year, because of my own will, clinging to morning workout routines the best I can to keep me from being ungrounded and messy. I find it far too easy to slip into unhealthy mindsets and behaviors, and far too hard to at the very least just be grounded and gratuitous.\nI threw myself to the fire believing that I could generate a decent passive income in a year\u0026rsquo;s time. I wanted and wanted, only to never quite get the discipline I needed, and the focus I needed to actually accomplish that.\nLook, I wanted to try new things to see what I liked and to see what’s practical. I made music. I started this blog. I tried stand-up comedy. I audited acting workshops. I talked to professionals in all kinds of industries and so much more.\nI wanted to try new things, and I’m glad I did, but as I mentioned, the end goal was to become my own boss and become financially dependent.\nDesire, desire, desire. I want, I need, I must have or else. Or else I’m a failure.\nOver the past year my desire for financial security obfuscated the truth and purity I wanted in my art, and even more importantly stressed me to the point where I couldn’t be in the moment during anything I did. It gives me this deep and lingering anxiety.\nI still believe I can do anything I set my mind to, but I still can’t make up my mind on what that thing is. The reality is that you must pursue goals one at a time, especially achieving expertise or proficiency at a craft, hobby, trade, etc. You can be anything, but it must be one at a time. (And you need financial support.) I can’t seem to bring myself to work on the same one thing every single day. I lose my balance constantly. Old fears and new anxieties feel anchored to my psyche. I can’t help but feel that I am what a modern Raskolnikov looks like.\nI don’t want to feel superior to people. An undeniable aspect of my life that I see as objective is the fact that I have been dealt a really good hand. I graduated university with minimal debt with a STEM degree, I live in a city that is a hub for creatives, I’m young and strong and take care of my body. At times I am showered with compliments. I’m a cis white man. I have support from family and friends. I truly believe that I am the only thing holding myself back. I take responsibility for as much as I can, or at least I always try to take responsibility for how I reacted to a situation.\nI have had much success over the past year, but it is so hard for me to see and feel that. Success isn’t linear and is defined by our own personal metrics.\nI constantly fear that I have all this potential and I’m wasting my time doing nothing “real” with it. I’d like to see real change in the world. I’d like to practice proper self-care. I’d love to stop hating myself so much and feeling like I’m just the most toxic person in the world.\nOkay, it\u0026rsquo;s getting late now. What’s the final conclusion? Am I going to do something about all this or am I just going to keep venting?\nI’ll try to be honest folks. This world is brutal. My life feels like a huge mess lately and I think my ego can’t stand to admit that. It never has. This book sent me on a spiral that I think I much needed, but a spiral it was indeed. Isolation and loneliness aren’t good ingredients for a good time. But ultimately, I’d like to get better at sharing my feelings.\nI want to mature as a person. Need those good old constructive and healthy conversations with like-minded individuals.\nYou’re not alone.\n~ IG: @tortured_.me\n","date":"22 March 2025","permalink":"/blog/2025/crime-and-punishment/","section":"Blogs","summary":"My thoughts and confessions regarding Crime \u0026amp; Punishment.","title":"Crime \u0026 Punishment"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/crime--punishment/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Crime \u0026 Punishment"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/mental-health/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Mental Health"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/brian-thompson/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Brian Thompson"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/capitalism/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Capitalism"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/luigi-mangione/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Luigi Mangione"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/nyc/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"NYC"},{"content":"Convictions #I wanted to talk about the recent occurrence of the fatal shooting of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Or more specifically, the now major suspect in question Luigi Mangione.\nIt is not confirmed if Luigi did it, it “appears” that there is a lot of evidence stacked against him at the moment. I must mention that the way he was caught and the evidence he had on him was very suspicious. Everything about him tells me that he is not a stupid person. I don’t know how so many pictures of him are appearing, but that’s not usually what happens when these kinds of things go down.\nNonetheless, he has been arrested, and he is now the primary suspect in this case.\nI want to make stuff when I feel extreme convictions to do so. I’d be lying to myself if I haven’t been having a lot of strong feelings and opinions that are resurgent and resonating from the core of my being because of all this.\nI feel for the CEO’s family, but I truly don’t have any empathy or care for him. I don’t care that he got killed or for the way he got killed.\nMy point here, however, is that it upsets me that I feel this way. It upsets me that I don’t have empathy. Not only upset about myself, but everybody else who feels the same. The like ratio on UnitedHealth Group’s Facebook post announcing his death is enough proof that it\u0026rsquo;s is true.\nI decided over a year ago to stay away from mainstream media as much as I can. However this incident has been a painful reminder that we don’t live in a healthy society. My worldview from my bubble is not the world. No society is perfect; none ever will be. This universe we live in will never be perfect. I’d argue that that’s what’s beautiful about it. It’s likely the main reason it’s even able to exist.\nWhen someone who is in a powerful position is targeted and shot dead in the street, and everyone’s reaction, besides the corporate media, is one of rejoice and satisfaction; it tells me that there is something very wrong. To me, it cannot be confirmed any more by anything else that there is something very wrong with the system, with our society’s morale, and where corporations stand.\n(I’d also like to add that the contrast between this case, and the one of Daniel Penny is astounding.)\nI think it might be true that there is nothing but soulless out-of-touch-with-reality individuals at the top. The people that have the most wealth and power are like that. Sociopaths, narcissists, and psychopaths win in this game of “see how much money you can make at all costs”, or “capitalism” for short. Currently money, and fame, but ultimately money, is the principal symbol of power.\nThe world is not what I was taught to believe it to be. I don’t think most people are born evil, but those born into powerful families are taught very different things than the average citizen. They learn to adapt and survive in that elite sphere, which is a wicked world I’m unfamiliar with.\nBrian Thompson was in that world, and that essentially makes him a leader, no?\nIn our capitalist society, on paper, as the head of the highest profiting health care company, you are certainly leading. Regardless of his wealth, with that title, the proper thing to consider him as is a \u0026ldquo;leader\u0026rdquo; in our society right? Otherwise, what are higher up individuals in large corporations supposed to be? Making decisions that effect other people means that one has control over them, but the modern idea is that whoever got to that position got there because of good decision-making, conduct, character, etc.. That’s leadership.\nIf we’re thinking logically about our capitalist system, as the most profitable health insurance company, it is to be assumed that Brian has become one of the best at fulfilling his responsibility to society in this respective field. UHC made more money than all their competitors because they served society the best. Or at least this must be true because they are a healthcare company. How else would they have earned this position? What else would they be trying to do? These lines become blurrier and blurrier the bigger a company gets. Its a process that I\u0026rsquo;d argue is inevitable.\nEven if CEOs don’t have all the say in their company, Brian surely had power and influence in modern society for the fact alone that he made 10 million dollars annually just from his salary.\nI don’t like using the word “should”. But when I think about it, yeah, we should be upset this guy with a wife and kids got killed. This guy who has employees to manage. Perhaps Brian was really trying his hardest to make his company better at providing healthcare? (I’m not even trying to say that sarcastically. It\u0026rsquo;s a shame I even have to even say this.) We should be outraged that he was able to get shot down and killed quickly on the street. We’d be outraged if that happened to anyone. We don’t condone murdering people. Right? Right everybody?\nSo why are we cruel and uncaring to him? Why are we showing vague excitement about this? Why is it online that I see some of us are encouraging the act of murdering more CEOs?\nWell did you figure out why? It is not rocket science to any proletariet. Maybe you caught the answer already in my words.\nIt’s all in the “we” here folks. It is not right vs. left. It never was and never will be. It is up vs. down. It is the millions and millions of hardworking blue collar and white collar individuals slaving away so that they may make a living, forced to do so because the wealth is NOT trickling down in enough fashion. Wealth trickling down can look like stopping inflation, not funding genocides, raising wages, more stimulus checks, literal wealth being passed down to others, etc, etc… You can only push a person so far. Everyone works harder and longer hours yet receives less compensation.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s the secert underlying existential and dreadful problem in everybody\u0026rsquo;s lives: the green paper.\nQuick rant:\nWhen I and others use the words “wealthy elite”, do me a favor and in your mind don’t picture the rich neighbor who lives down your street. Don’t picture the guy who’s got two houses, four cars, and goes on vacations ten times a year because he got into a drop shipping niche.\nThose people are probably living well, but their wealth is nothing compared to the picture I want you to have. The picture of the people that have so much money they couldn’t spend it all if they had multiple lifetimes. The people with a net worth of billions. The people running the entire world’s show. The people making deals with tyrannical and oppressive governments for their resources. The people perpetuating deadly wars around the globe so the military industrial complex could profit. The people who are CEOs of the most profitable health insurance company at number 5 on the Fortune 500.\nLike Brian Thompson.\nI’m not going to name names for you. Because you already know some of them. Because it’s important to know that these people don’t operate in the shadows that they want you to think they’re in. They want you to fear them. But they’re made of the same flesh and blood, and they walk down the same streets you do.\nWe Need To Change The Idea of What Good Business Means #Making money is not always a sign of something beneficial happening. In fact the more money being made, the more likely this is true. Outsourcing all your manufacturing overseas to get your product made for slave wages is seen as good business. Upselling the price of insulin by literally hundreds of dollars is seen as good business. Using A.I. to deny more claims than your competitors, is good business.\nThe people of the world can only stomach so much. People only want to participate in society if they think it is fair and just enough for them and everyone else to work for it. If you give people nothing to live for, they’ll have nothing to lose.\nWith companies continuing to not be held accountable for actions that hurt society, when our justice and regulatory institutions fail us, society will take the matters into their own hands more and more.\nNYC #I was in NYC quite recently on a little day trip, and no, I did not stroll by the Hilton December 4th with a vengeance. The blatant and obvious classism that was put on display in this city was very disturbing to me. I saw all walks of life for sure, it’s why I have a love for New York. But since I’m not from there, it stuck out like a sore thumb. And also I will mention that I was only in Manhattan, so perhaps these observations are only about Manhattan.\nFor example, I saw teenagers walking around dressed in outfits most people can’t afford. Right after that that, a block away, I saw an entire homeless family with little children. I don’t know if those kids were the oblivious type of ultra wealthy kin I unfortunately took them for, and I don’t know if that homeless family actually needed the help they said they did on their cardboard sign. The fact I can’t swallow is that both of these parties existed right next to each other.\nI’m not necessarily talking about those teenagers I saw when I say this, but the sense of dehumanization I see in the ultra-wealthy is quite disturbing. They don’t treat and see humans as humans. I’m not sure if they even see themselves as a human.\nOnline, the wave of class consciousness I’ve seen, and the paragraphs and paragraphs of people venting there horrible experiences with health insurance companies is so surreal. From now on, in political arguments, left vs. right, how about we always start here. From here on out let us start with our thoughts and feelings about the killing of the United Healthcare CEO, and why we all unanimously didn’t care and still don’t.\nLuigi Mangione # I want to talk about Luigi Mangione. After I read all the information people have found online about him, I’ve concluded that he is 100% a sane person. In fact, he is a model citizen. High school valedictorian, Ivy League graduate, CS major, dedicated to personal development and working out, described as an articulate and compassionate person who founded and held a bookclub.\nWhether he killed this CEO or not, his social profile conveys a lot of valid thoughts and convictions that can be backed up by factual data and well-acclaimed allegorical literature. He appears to have struggled with extreme backpain that\u0026rsquo;s dramatically changed the course of his life and left him in shambles.\nA huge problem with our society\u0026rsquo;s laws, with our human perception, is the idea of when things happen directly and indirectly. I’m going to get long-winded here, but bear with me because some people don’t actually understand this.\nWhoever actually killed this CEO, did this directly. By that I mean someone took out a gun and shot him until he was dead. There is 100% undeniable proof of this from camera footage showing the assault and death.\nWe call this murder. As humans, when we socialize and survive together, we don’t tolerate that. We’ve agreed for obvious reasons that killing each other is not good. For moral reasons, logical reasons, obvious reasons right? Society and everyone in it agrees that we don’t like murder, and we don’t tolerate the act and the people who do it.\nHowever when the murdering happens, but isn’t able to be measured in a tangible way, all of the sudden murdering is fine.\nIt’s okay. It’s allowed. It’s expected.\nAll of the sudden when you and your loved ones are denied life saving treatments (if you can even afford health insurance) because of a new A.I.’s determination, well that’s fine. That’s actually great for business.\nIts business as usual. UHC is a multi-billion dollar company because what it does is “legal” under the current laws we have.\nWe can’t measure how many people a health insurance company is killing because in the eyes of the laws we currently have, denying claims just means they’re not giving you money this time around. (Even though this is what we are paying them every month for.)\nIt’s indirect. It’s legal. So as long as it’s legal, someone being denied can always be written off. It doesn’t matter whether they actually did or didn’t need the healthcare to survive or have a reasonable quality of life. They’ve decided for you. With their opinion. The people who aren’t even healthcare professionals. They decided that you do not get the care that a provider determined may help you. Care they determined WILL help you.\nI know there are a lot of other factors at play that go into financing healthcare. Just remember that the U.S. is the only developed nation without universal care. Our governmental and justice institutions have failed us by allowing this to happen and let it get worse and worse.\nIn a way, UHC was doing a good job under the eyes of the United States. It was making money, and its supposed to keep growing. That\u0026rsquo;s the desired outcome of any business.\nI think the only reason a health insurance company should deny a claim is if they think it is legitimately fraudulent. Besides the minority of cosmetic purposes, who the hell wants to get a surgery? Who would not just rather be healthy so they don’t have to waste their time and money?\nMore importantly, should we be letting for-profit and healthcare be in the same sentence?\nIt’s okay to make money as long as it’s “legal”.\nWe’re Not Made For This World #So on the topic of change, I’ll say that we as humans aren’t biologically designed to worry about millions, thousands, even hundreds of other people. This makes one understand the actions of the wealthy elite and everyone else in general.\nMost citizens don’t spend their free time taking any real measures to change things, and they won’t be mad if you do the same. Most people want to enjoy the little free time they have when they’re not working. No one blames anyone for doing this because we all do it. The gems of human beings that would devote their lives to trying to enact widespread change are often the ones who don’t have the time or money to do so because they’re worried about financial survival. Sometimes even actual survival.\nThe fabric of society is held together by our imaginations. The veil is thin. In fact, the veil doesn’t actually exist.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a clear, obvious, and intense intution I have. How when we wake up sleep-deprived for work at 6am, drive to a job that we don\u0026rsquo;t get any satisfaction doing, meanwhile being psychologically bombarded by constant ads on highways and screens, and having to drive cars everywhere while we also don\u0026rsquo;t know if we\u0026rsquo;re going to make rent next month, is not normal. This is not how humans are supposed to live, this state of having constant microstresses.\nSo many aspects of how we live are backwards and misaligned with how humans work biologically, physically, spiritually, etc.. But that’s a topic I’m not going to chase to much at this moment.\nLuigi’s Review of Ted Kacynzki’s Manifesto. #If you don\u0026rsquo;t know who Ted Kacynzki is, look him up.\nLuigi wrote this after reading the Unabomber’s manifesto:\nI think if Luigi is the assailant, I believe he acted this way out of good faith. I think he did it from a place I can relate to. One desiring hope that a vile action can cause change that will better humanity. In fact it already has. Killing that CEO was a symbol FOR morality, not against it.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve never in my life seen a class consciousness spike as high as the one I\u0026rsquo;ve seen this week.\nMurdering people isn’t productive. Murdering specific people however might be. Just ask the C.I.A. and U.S. military.\nViolence is and always will be a part of nature, and a part of our nature. It has its place. The media will make you think that throwing a brick through a window is an act of violence. They’ll make you think that whoever threw it is a criminal and must be detained and tried.\nI don’t see it as that. I simply see it as a symptom. A natural symptom to something bigger. The bigger thing being the true violence happening upon whoever through that brick. There is violence happening to them and it is the reason they were overcome by conviction to throw it through a window. They enacted direct violence as a result of indirect violence, but violence is all the same.\nMake no mistake, there is no difference between them. This indirect violence I\u0026rsquo;m talking about is systemic.\nHere are some examples of indirect/systemic violence:\nDiabetes manufactures (Eli Lilly, Novo Nodisk, and Sandi) inflate the price of insulin as much as they can get away with in America, but it’s indirect violence. So it’s fine.\nOil companies polluting the environment, and ravaging the earth so much so that the world will be uninhabitable in due time. But that’s not violence.\nNestle is responsible for horrific crises of obesity, nutrition, and water in the U.S. and around the world. So much that there is a whole community with 275k followers dedicated to boycotting them: r/fucknestle But that’s not violence.\nUnited Healthcare rejected 32% of claims, over half the industry average, and made billions. But that’s not violence.\nI think Luigi cares about society more than most people. If it was him, it was because he didn’t know what to do to help society in the ways he wanted to. He didn’t believe his ideas were working, and saw this action as the only thing that can change that.\nIf it was him, I believe that’s exactly what happened here. Unless things actually start changing, unless people believe they have a future, targeted acts like this are going to grow more common.\nLuigi shared a lot of his concerns on his X (twitter), with his pinned post warning about the potenital for A.I.. He shared pieces of literature that address modern societal issues. He was not someone waiting for handouts. This link has all his tweets that you can view without going on X (twitter):\nhttps://nitter.poast.org/PepMangione\nGo check out what he spread awareness on and what he talked about. Think for yourself. I’ve read Brave New World and 1984. There’s a reason they’re popular in grade school education here in the west. Read them and think for yourself.\nLuigi isn’t some bum. He did everything he was supposed to as a young person, despite many health odds stacked against him, and yet he felt incapable of producing the real change he wanted to see. Change that a model citizen like him should feel like he has the agency to do.\nI just got his manifesto after writing all this. Here it is:\n“To the Feds, I\u0026rsquo;ll keep this short, because I do respect what you do for our country. To save you a lengthy investigation, I state plainly that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t working with anyone. This was fairly trivial: some elementary social engineering, basic CAD, a lot of patience. The spiral notebook, if present, has some straggling notes and To Do lists that illuminate the gist of it. My tech is pretty locked down because I work in engineering so probably not much info there. I do apologize for any strife or traumas but it had to be done. Frankly, these parasites simply had it coming. A reminder: the US has the #1 most expensive healthcare system in the world, yet we rank roughly #42 in life expectancy. United is the [indecipherable] largest company in the US by market cap, behind only Apple, Google, Walmart. It has grown and grown, but has our life expectancy? No the reality is, these [indecipherable] have simply gotten too powerful, and they continue to abuse our country for immense profit because the American public has allowed them to get away with it. Obviously the problem is more complex, but I do not have space, and frankly I do not pretend to be the most qualified person to lay out the full argument. But many have illuminated the corruption and greed (e.g.: Rosenthal, Moore), decades ago and the problems simply remain. It is not an issue of awareness at this point, but clearly power games at play. Evidently I am the first to face it with such brutal honesty.”\nHe said it first, at this point “it is not an issue of awareness…”. I agree. I think that given all the media everyone’s been forced to swallow in the 21st century, you either have the awareness of the true evil that exists, the actual evil that plagues our world, or you don’t.\nMost people do though. Most people are aware. Again, it’s why no one cares about this CEO. It’s why everyone hates most corporations. It is either simple math to someone as to why this is, or they\u0026rsquo;re [indecipherable].\nWhy I Don\u0026rsquo;t Care #I’ll be honest folks. I want to tell you the reason I don’t spread awareness on political and social issues anymore. The reason I almost didn’t vote this election. The reason I don’t go to protests. The reason I don’t use what little platform I do have to try and jumpstart social change.\nI’m going to tell you why, and I bet it’s why many people like me are the same. I see a lot of people on social media who are politically charged. And I’d say I feel just as charged if not more than them. But not politically speaking.\nDemocrat vs. Republic politics have long been a joke to me, secretly being America’s real pastime. I try my best to not ever pay attention, except when I laugh at the absurdism of our presidential debates. I do think our government can make real change happen if those in our government acted in the true interests of their constituents and country, and weren’t corrupted, or blackmailed into obeying.\nPower tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\nStimulus checks were real, progressive amendments have been passed, but I don’t ever tell myself that they’ll be reliable when the real sh*t hits the fan. In my eyes they’ve already failed us. It’s too late. The silver lining of Trump to me is that I think he\u0026rsquo;ll speed up this collapse.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s how I honestly feel, I wish I thought differently.\nInsurance companies alone have spent over 100 million dollars lobbying.\nOverall our species fails to see distant existential problems because their consequences aren’t happening in the present. We’re designed to adapt to problems as we face them. We’ve planned and prepared for a year ahead at most, not decades or centuries.\nCorporations and bad actors have sunken their fingers into politicians, and they make sure they don’t dare make drastic changes to their systems.\nWhat I’ll say though, is that I am charged in general.\nDeep down I always am, and I think I always will be. I refuse to sink into a life of ignorance where my soul’s subconscious begs to have its sins purged.\nIt’s not right and left issues. Most policy discussion is fodder to me. Not that I don’t care about women’s rights, or trans rights, or the border-crisis, etc. I voted for Kamala Harris mainly to protect women’s rights to abortion. I care, and it’s obvious to me who around me also does. I am part of the lgbt+ and although I wish the world was more understanding and accommodating, lgbt+ concerns are far from the forefront of my mind. It’s not that I don’t care, I care a whole lot, but in my mind we’ll get to them once more pressing problems get fixed.\nThe problems with the powers that be.\nIf only we can learn to focus on them one at a time.\nYou see, because of technology, so many people have finally been given agency to talk about social problems not talked about before. This has given all kinds of minority groups a chance to speak up and have more agency than ever before. I fully support that and encourage it. I mean who wouldn’t?!\nThe elite at play aren’t entirely stupid though. They have control and influence and teams of people helping them combat class consciousness.\nThey know this would happen with modern technology, so they\u0026rsquo;re trying as much as they can to control all major communication/media platforms. It\u0026rsquo;s why not a single major media outlet is addressing the morale and ethos of the American people following this killing. For once something that happened can\u0026rsquo;t be spun into a culture war, and they\u0026rsquo;re clutching their pearls.\nThey are bought and sold. If you pay attention, for once FOX and CNN are agreeing on something. Because they represent their corporate/elite owners. This should disturb you.\nThey control these outlets so that they can continue to convince us that our neighbor is to blame for the injustice and decay that’s happening before our eyes and not them. This brainwashing is rampant everywhere, on most platforms to some degree, but is the most prevalent on mainstream media outlets, and top social media sites. It will never work in the long run, but they’ve been buying themselves time while everyone is amusing themselves to death and distracted by nonsense.\nBy prolonging the inevitable change we need, they are only going to make future strife play out in uglier and uglier ways.\nSo no, I don’t make posts or stories anymore about atrocities our government makes. Especially when they’re on the same sites that give me an ad for Wendy\u0026rsquo;s right after I post something. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry not sorry.\nI don’t go to protests, I don’t keep myself constantly informed on global, national, or even local news. I don’t do these things, because I don’t think they do anything but waste our time. I don’t think it brings about the real change we need.\nAwareness is good, but like I said, I\u0026rsquo;ve seen enough. I know enough, I remember enough. When things happen that need the public eye on it, I know other like-minded people are spreading the awareness needed. I salute them.\nI think it is more productive to do other things. To focus on yourself and your community. Become the best you can be, so that you may be the best “you” to help others. It\u0026rsquo;s not selfish. Do things you enjoy for yourself. Give back to others. Do things because you want to, and not for money. Do as much of those things as you can. None of us are here forever.\nUltimately, I believe the actual change we need to survive as a species will inevitably begin someday in my life time. I believe it will come in the form of direct violence. I will always wish I was wrong. I will always wish that the optimist in me was right, and not the realist.\nDeep down I think most people know that shocking acts like this make the impacts we want and need. But few people do it because they’re scared of dying, facing a lifetime in prison, and worrying about their loved ones, including myself. I wish the world wasn’t like this because deep down I know it doesn’t have to be.\nWe lie to ourselves and say that the consequences of inaction won’t come to fruition, but one day they will. And we’ll wish we would have done something.\nI do not condone violence, but if someone else decides to carry out a form of it, just remember:\nBoardrooms, not classrooms.\nNow go get back to work!\n","date":"10 December 2024","permalink":"/blog/2024/luigi-magione/","section":"Blogs","summary":"Upon the recent shooting in the street of UHC CEO, I\u0026rsquo;ve felt extreme conviction to vent my thoughts and feelings about it and about the alleged assailant Luigi Mangione.","title":"The Understandable Convictions of Luigi Mangione"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/uhc-ceo/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"UHC CEO"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/violence/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Violence"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/all-day-special/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"All Day Special"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/bullied-by-the-elderly/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Bullied by the Elderly"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/channel-65/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Channel 65"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/delaware-ave/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Delaware Ave"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/esta-coda/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Esta Coda"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/good-things-are-happening/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Good Things Are Happening"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/hardcore/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Hardcore"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/if-kansas-had-trees/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"If Kansas Had Trees"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/joe-burke/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Joe Burke"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/live-music/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Live Music"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/music/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Music"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/nepa-horror-fest/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"NEPA Horror Fest"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/pollen/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Pollen"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/rosary-guild/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Rosary Guild"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/scranton/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Scranton"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/scranton-punk-co/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Scranton Punk Co"},{"content":"Intro to Scranton #What is the Scranton Scene? What do I mean when I say that? Why I am of course referring to the diy/underground music scene in the lovely northeastern Pennsylvania city of Scranton.\nFor those of you who don’t know, I am actually from the city of Scranton. I grew up around the area in a place I describe as \u0026ldquo;where the country meets the suburbs\u0026rdquo;, or something like that. It\u0026rsquo;s home, and I’ve grown to appreciate it more. Even though the weather can get rainy and cold as f**k.\nWhile home for the holidays this past November I shot a music video for one of my favorite local indie bands “Pollen”. I consider these guys my homies as they have proven to be absolute lads. Other than shooting the music video, which I’ll get to in a sec, I had the pleasure of seeing a delectable show at the River Street Jazz Cafe in Wilkes-Barre.\nAll of these happenings around Scranton made me think to myself, “Hey I know quite a bit about the Scranton scene, why not talk about it?” So here we are. You\u0026rsquo;re reading it. Cool.\nAs a disclaimer this is not an objective view of the scene. This is just what I’ve come to know and map out from my perspective and experiences. I’m kind of just rambling folks.\nPollen #So as I said a moment ago, while I was home for the holidays I shot a music video for Pollen. I directed it and got all the footage I’ll need. Now it\u0026rsquo;s just time to edit. Music videos take a long time kids. The boys in Pollen kind of let me do what I wanted, so some main goals with the video for myself were to try and see if I can shoot a long uncut shot, and also try out recording to my family’s old video cassette camcorder. My homie and bass God Jack has got the convertor jawn.\nI\u0026rsquo;m going to take my time to make sure this video is a masterpiece. Shoutout to Jackie and Gariepy for being in the video. Thank you guys.\nWhat’s the deal with Pollen? Do I even like them? Will they ever figure out it was me who leaked their CC numbers and SSNs?\nI call them the Scranton supergroup because they have musicians that all play in other notable bands. They got Albert from Bullied by The Elderly on guitar, Timmy from All Day Special on bass, Ian from Channel 65 on drums, and Caleb from Texas. And no not Texas the band (I don’t know if that exists), Texas the state. I swear this dude came out of nowhere.\nCaleb plays guitar, is the lead vocalist, and is their signature songwriter. From what they’ve told me, Pollen’s music comes from a wide selection of songs that Caleb has written during his youth. I hope I’m allowed to say that. Is that supposed to be a secret? Anyways, they’ve recently put out a new record “Coy”, now streaming on all platforms. Everything was recorded and mixed by Albert in his home studio where, funnily enough some parts of the music video were shot. The music video will be for their song “Feud”, and as for a release date, let’s just say I’m hoping to finish it before the end of the year. Ultimately it\u0026rsquo;ll be up to them.\nBut yeah I love when I get the chance to play with these guys. Ian is an absolute unit on the drums, Timmy embodies the musical spirit and prowess of Flea, Albert is a true diy connoisseur and madman, and Caleb is a chill \u0026amp; passionate frontman who knows how to write good a** songs.\nOkay, I’m done gassing them up now. Just go listen to them.\nSHOW RECAP 2 | River Street Jazz Cafe. # I saw this show last Saturday at the River Street Jazz Cafe with If Kansas Had Trees, Joe Burke and Co, Rosary Guild, and Esta Coda.\nThe only band I was familiar with from this bill was If Kansas Had Trees, and I was very excited to hear them live for the first time. I met Maddux and Stone at a Fosh show a little while back and we got them on the bill for “The Show” I mentioned earlier. (Unfortunately the date couldn\u0026rsquo;t work out for them.) This time I finally got the chance to meet their frontman Joey, who was super friendly as I expected. He pours his heart out, especially on their new album \u0026ldquo;Where You Thought You Would Be\u0026rdquo;.\nThey sounded awesome live. While watching them I loved how tight they were, how on pitch they were, and how they matched their music’s energy. I look forward to their future. Something wicked cool is they’ll be playing with Hot Mulligan and Tigers Jaw for a little weekender at the end of the month. Go to the “Ho Ho Hot Mulligan” shows if you’re reading this and live near Detroit or Michigan.\nThe other bands I was unfamiliar with but they were all nice surprises.\nJoe Burke and Co. to me was as pure as they come as far as singer/songwriter music goes. They were moody, but also remained upbeat by retaining a lot of pop structure in the songwriting. It was easy listening. Joe Burke surely has his heart on his sleeve, and on his vocal cords. I was geeking out over their cover/rendition of ‘Walking on a Dream’ by Empire of the Sun. They slowed it down and played it more acoustic, letting the lyrics ring out even more. That was exactly how you do a rendition.\nRosary Guild, I must mention, had some of the nicest looking equipment I’ve ever seen. They had a beautiful and shiny orange Starcaster and a glittering telecaster. I wanted them. Why yes I did indeed. However, having good gear doesn’t mean you know to use it, but fortunately this didn’t apply to them. These guys may have captivated me the most, and that would likely be due to the fact that listening to them made me reminiscent of Radiohead. They painted a deep and rich soundscape with harmonies and synths that put me straight into my feelings. I’m very thankful that they have a record out so you can check them out. Go listen to Fauna.\nOkay, I lied a bit. I did hear some buzz about Esta Coda through the grapevine long ago. They were good, and they proved that these last three bands were seasoned veterans of their craft. The last three bands all appeared to be friends, with Esta Coda having some of the same vocalists and musicians from the prior two bands come on stage for some songs. (I believe the guitarist may be in both bands.) If I had to bet, this appeared to be a “homie” show for them. The lead singer of University Drive made an appearance and sang some of the songs with them. (I think their lead singer actually got sick? Don’t quote me on that.) These guys had a very warm vibe, and had the lighthearted stage banter I’ve only ever seen once before when I saw Panchiko. It was a swell time for sure.\nAlso props to the sound guy at this jazz cafe for making this night exceptional. You know how to do your job.\nWilkes-Barre #Even though this is supposed to be about the Scranton Scene, I can\u0026rsquo;t do it without mentioning Wilkes-Barre as well. Its it\u0026rsquo;s other half. They must go together, and they both enrich and compliment the other. It\u0026rsquo;s where I saw the show I just talked about. These two cities are right next to each other and their scenes very much overlap in the modern day. Wilkes-Barre had, and still does, a notorious hardcore scene. I found this interesting trailer for a documentary called Pennsylvania Hardcore: https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop\u0026v=9X4i4B4ccTw\nI didn’t see a hardcore show while I was home, but it’s worth mentioning. Some big bands have come out of Scranton and Wilkes-Barre and the wonderful hardcore phenomenon around this town is a big reason for that. Shoutout to VFWs.\nScranton Punk Co #I felt like it is essential for me to mention Jess and Rae Meoni of the Scranton Punk Co if I’m talking about the Scranton scene. The last Dimmer show of the year was set up through them, and we rocked Jess’s house in West Side for a benefit show alongside Pollen and Salem Moon. Salem Moon, who I unfortunately didn’t get the chance to see that night as they were on first. Luckily, Direct Action United recorded all the sets from that night, and I\u0026rsquo;ve also seen Salem when they played \u0026ldquo;The Show\u0026rdquo;. They are one of my favorite upcoming bands. I\u0026rsquo;m interseted in what they\u0026rsquo;ll do next.\nFests #Before I forget, last September I set up a diy festival by partnering up with Kayla Grezch, a local concert photographer and vocalist in Look Back Luna. We set this up at St. Mary’s Center in the heart of Scranton. We called it \u0026ldquo;The Show\u0026rdquo;, as I keep referencing, and it was a complete success. I was ecstatic that I got to curate a bill like that. We 100% plan on putting it on again next year and making it an annual thing. There are a bunch of photos and videos on the show\u0026rsquo;s ig (@theshownepa) in case you want to see what you missed. Kayla, thank you again for handling the social media and making all the flyers and content. Go follow us so you can get updates for next year!\nThere are two other notable fests in Scranton that I\u0026rsquo;m aware of. One is the one and only Good Things Are Happening fest which is helped put together by Scranton Punk Co, and which got Wicca Phase Springs Eternal to headline this past year! I’ve been wanting to go for the past two years. It happens outside at the giant Scranton Iron Furnaces, and they’ve got a really cool website: https://goodthingsfestpa.com/.\nThe other one is NEPA Horror Fest that happens at the Circle Drive in Theatre that has punk bands and a meet and greet with actors that were in iconic horror movies. I always found this fest to be a truly unique and special one, and it\u0026rsquo;s also curated by Scranton Punk Co as well.\nVenues #The most popular venue I’ve heard from word of mouth is in the heart of Scranton. It\u0026rsquo;s called the V-Spot. It\u0026rsquo;s just north of downtown and allows for some of the best live sound I’ve heard. However if I found a genie lamp, I would wish they had more room.\nI would also wish for two more genie lamps.\nAnother one is The Ritz. It is a renewed theatre venue downtown, but as of now I\u0026rsquo;d say it\u0026rsquo;s far too expensive to book if you’re a small band just starting out. That is unless a bigger band let\u0026rsquo;s you open for them.\nThere is also the Keystone Stage in Olyphant as well which is great for open mic nights if you’re just starting out. From conversations I’ve had, Scranton needs more diy venues as the scene appears to be growing. Not that I haven’t heard great praise about Jared’s house, but the more the merrier in this situation.\nSpeedrun #Okay let’s treat this like a speedrun and wrap up this post already.\nI ought to mention Kayla Grezch again as I said she helped me out immensely with setting up “The Show”, and it honestly wouldn’t have happened without her. But also, she truly is very active in the scene, doing a lot of concert photography and singing in Look Back Luna. They have been releasing quite a bit of music recently, so go check out their emo indie rock nonsense. (Their words not mine.)\nAnother concert photographer to mention is Dom Kozuch. Their photography is very colorful and saturated. I hope to catch them at a show sometime and I hope they keep up the shooting! Not the gunshot kind!\nChannel 65 is an indie outfit that Ian from Pollen plays in. I made this music video for there song \u0026ldquo;Lil Buddy\u0026rdquo; you can watch here. Song goes hard and always will. I hope they keep making heavier stuff because if they do I’m here for it. Ian, Hunter, and Spenny have my full attention.\nAll Day Special is a must see live band as their frontman Jack loses his mind and body to the music and belts out every word straight from his soul. As I mentioned earlier this is the band that Timmy from Pollen also plays in. Go check them out. They have music out, and the aura is off the charts. Seeing them live was a spectacle to behold. So see them if you want to move irresistibly.\nBullied By the elderly is Albert’s garage rock band with some of his homies. They released a new project this year called Sonic-Infringement that’s got a lot of great psychedelic stuff happening. I think the album cover here matches the music perfectly. It\u0026rsquo;s some feel good rock with great harmonies and lots of cool ideas. I’m sure they dream for the return of their vocalist Kara, but regardless I hope they keep up the good work.\nDelaware Ave is another local band I’ve been trying to see for a minute. They\u0026rsquo;re the only band on here I\u0026rsquo;m talking about that I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen live. I was on a bill with them once when they went by \u0026ldquo;The Crates\u0026rdquo; but the venue ended up not working out. I wanted to briefly talk about them because I used to work with their frontman Chris back in highschool. I haven’t seen him in person since then, but I have no doubt that I will eventually. I mention this because I think this speaks to the power of music and how it brings people together. They also released a new single that your Kids Are Gonna Love.\nWild Red is another pop punk/post hardcore group from Wilkes-Barre who I’ve mentioned on this blog before. That guy Jonah doesn’t stop.\nMan I didn’t even get to mention James Barrett, or Pucker Up!, or Petal, and so many more! I think I’ll have to write part two to this post sometime in the future. It\u0026rsquo;s impossible to encampsulate a scene in words. You got to experience it for yourself. Likely when I’ve been exposed to more of the Scranton scene, I can go into more depth next time. I’d like to give the bands, photographers, promoters, venues etc. the proper credit and write up they deserve.\nAll this stuff takes a lot of time. Setting up shows, making music, editing photos, networking\u0026hellip; its all a lot of work and for the most part, there\u0026rsquo;s no financial incentive. Any city’s scene is a never-ending rabbit hole of names and faces, and musicians and their side projects. I feel like blog posts I make like these are becoming straight journalism at this point. I know this is my blog and I can do whatever the heck I want, but I think if I\u0026rsquo;m going to do this I want to do it right. Get better and better. Especially since I\u0026rsquo;m putting them out there more now.\nMy spider web of knowledge of the Scranton scene is mine, and I\u0026rsquo;ll reemphasize that its not an objective reflection of the scene. I’m saying this to prevent someone from Scranton, who I didn’t mention, who gives their life to this shit from punching a hole in their wall. (But I\u0026rsquo;m also still learning to live with the fact that not everyone is going to like you.)\nOverall I think a lot of these Scranton/Wilkes-Barre bands have deep roots with classic rock, but the more I hear them make music and stick together, the more I can sense the modern influences slowly seeping into their new creations.\nThe internet is a wonderful thing. There has never been a better time to be an enjoyer and maker of music. I’m excited to see this scene grow.\nI hope you enjoyed the read, I’ll see you next time. If I mentioned you, let me know what you think of this perhaps? I am looking to improve this stuff.\nAlso, totally optional, but you can buy me a Ko-Fi if you’d like to support.\nPeace \u0026lt;3\nChannel 65 balling up via there IG\n","date":"8 December 2024","permalink":"/blog/2024/scranton-scene/","section":"Blogs","summary":"I talk about the Scranton Scene and also squeeze in another show recap.

Where I recap my thoughts about the acts I see performing live music both large and underground.\nI wish I started this sooner as I’ve seen many shows in my day. From dark humid basements, all the way to Wells Fargo Stadium, I’ve seen countless shows. I absolutely do not want to know how much I’ve spent on concert tickets in the last five years of my adolescence. Don’t worry though, I’m financially stable (for the most part) and I’m proud to be a concert junkie. I’m just glad I can provide something like this to other people who might be interested. It’s the least I can do.\nPlease note that I am not a critic, I am recapping the shows and mentioning my personal background knowledge and experience with the bands and artists I see. I ain’t doing this for every show I go to. I’m just doing it for the shows I want to. Also, I believe as a rule of thumb that when it comes to this stuff that if you don’t have anything nice to say don’t say it at all.\nLast night on Friday 11/22/24 I saw a show at a Temple house show venue called Over Yonder. I think it has become the best house show venue in Philly, (at least in North), that gets as professional as one can be in this setting, with a good emphasis on sound control and making sure the neighbors are okay with it. The name of this venue is probably one of the most clever I’ve heard, and not to be a suck up, but I think this idea speaks to the ingenuity, and energy that is the Machine. The Machine is a promoter/community collective in Philly that books all kinds of shows, but I would say, and they’d probably agree, that they gravitate more to the rave, dj, and electronic scene. This show however, was a classic 4 band basement bill with an eclectic cast. Prior to this show I have been referring to this bill as the “homie show” hence why I’m eager to blog about it. I love all these bands and all my friends who play in them.\nSmall Head Big Torso Vicious Grip #Perhaps the most mysterious band on the bill to me, as friends of the Machine, I knew I was in for a treat. I’ve briefly spoken to the guitarist, Gio, as well as seen them around a lot. Particularly one time at an Unwound show in Jersey City. From my brief interactions, I’ve sensed the moral convictions within them that they strive to uphold, and they’re determination certainly poured out explosively into their performance and the music itself.\nWith one guitarist, one drummer, and two line-outs, I was so happy to see this band match the exact energy I imagined an act called “Small Head Big Torso Vicious Grip” would exude. And that is what punk music is about. Its losing one’s voice by the end of the set from screaming, having “FUCK” and “gentrification” stickers on their gear, dragging a rack tom into the audience for people to smack as they please, and sprinkling some Unwound in there indeed. If you see this band, do them a favor and bring your energy. Oh, and earplugs.\nSHBTVG IG\nWallace, Tonight! #The Philly House show scene would not feel the same to me without the presence of Wallace, Tonight!. Performing as a five piece at this show due to the fabulous return of their drummer Grace, they proved that they can, and will, rock your house down if you ask them. I’ve been blessed over the past couple years to be able to converse and hang out with all five of them at some point or another and I just wanted to mention that as far as people go they are all absolute lads. Plus they’re great musicians.\nTheir most recent release of their single “Wrinkler” tickles my brain so well, and may be my favorite so far in the Wallace discography. There is something special about hearing a live band perform countless times and then to have that music available at any time in your ears. I love live sets on the internet, but studios get the real job done.\nSonically speaking Wallace, Tonight is tight, energetic, and captivating. Will they hate me if I say they’re fun too? I have fun listening and watching them. I just do. I know I do because I have a big wide grin on my face the whole time. Since I’ve seen them so much, it might be time to admit that I’ve developed some nostalgia for their music as well. I find they’re music easy to listen to, and I mean that as a compliment. I feel that despite their wide array of grandiose landscapes and complex playing styles. Saying that they are “easy to listen to” doesn’t mean that they’re slow in the tempo department either. They can get a mosh going without even trying. “Keep Going” gets my heart pumping and my mind racing every time.\nWith the return of Grace, I’m excited to see what these guys cook up in the coming months. I love Wallace, Tonight!. Sue me.\n(Also shoutout their YouTube channel some of them run: Wallace, Watches! You can check out all kinds of live sets there, as well as all the sets from tonight. Go listen to Wallace, Tonight! tonight!)\nWallace, Tonight! IG\nAll the Flowers #There was a time when All the Flowers was not on my conscience. Like I guess everything is initially. That was until I was smacked in the face with their EP “Those You’ve Known and Loved”. Okay I might’ve lied, I think I knew a crumb of information, and that was that that one guy from RowTone, (who I now know as Ryan), played in this band. I now know more though. I now know that All the Flowers set a personal music record for me, and that is the fact that they made me cry.\nAm I getting too dramatic?\nBut no seriously… they’re music is beautiful, and it made me cry. Their particular shade of instrumentals, combined with the very honest and relatable lyrics, and well sung vocal harmonies led me straight to my feelings. Instrumentally, there are not too many bands in Philly, or bands in general I know of that have a violinist. They did. (I apologize if it\u0026rsquo;s actually a viola, my dumbass doesn’t know the difference.) And for me it applies as the perfect cherry on top of everything else they got going on.\nIf you like their music on streaming, they sound awesome live! They know how to put on a show. I love when all of them sing into the microphone at the same time. \u0026lt;3\nAll the Flowers IG\nMormon Toasterhead #I first saw Mormon Toaster Head in a really hot and humid basement in South Philly two summers ago. What I left with was a minor state of shock as I couldn’t comprehend what their frontman and guitarist Benzo Von Vivant was doing, and how the hell it was working so well!? A lot of conceptions I had of how one should play guitar got thrown out the window. I hate the word “should”. Anyways, what I just said is a bit of an overstatement. I’m being dramatic. However if there was ever a local band that threw me for a loop because of their live performance, it would be Mormon Toaster Head.\nBennett Hammy, my good friend, yueblum legend, ex-Dimmer bassist, and certified cutie, has fruitfully been added to Mormon’s roster as a second guitarist. This is likely due to his insane aura, talent, and the friendly connection he formed with their drummer Charlie.\nThe tones, the vibe, everything sounded awesome. The sound levels in general were good throughout the whole night. Just ask the stupid grins on my and John from Wallace, Tonight’s face. They’ve been playing a lot of their new unreleased stuff which I like and which Bennett won’t leak to me no matter how much I ask him. I’ll give him a pass for playing well. Especially during the jam session they had at the end of their set, which might have ended up being my favorite part. Either that or them referencing Infinite Jest. Although after reading their bio on Spotify the reference lines up.\nListening to their music, I find it so refreshingly original, uplifting, and fantastic! My favorite song is “Butterfly Museum”. I hope they play it live one day. Listen to their new album “Free Wheel”!\nMormon Toaster Head IG\nGo listen to the livesets if you want here -\u0026gt; Link\nSee yah next time!\n","date":"23 November 2024","permalink":"/blog/2024/show-recap/","section":"Blogs","summary":"Show recap for SHBTVG, Wallace, Tonight!, All the Flowers, and Mormon Toasterhead @OverYonder","title":"SHOW RECAP 1 \"Going Over Yonder\""},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/small-head-big-torso-vicious-grip/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Small Head Big Torso Vicious Grip"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/the-machine/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"The Machine"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/wallace-tonight/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Wallace, Tonight!"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/annie-dirusso/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Annie DiRusso"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/buice/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Buice"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/cage-the-elephant/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Cage the Elephant"},{"content":"Here is something a little different than my usual blog posts. I saw a reddit thread where someone asked reddit what concerts exceeded their expectations and which concerts didn’t. I’m going to have two categories. One for those who exceeded my expectations, and one for those who didn’t meet them. I’m going to loosely order them from bigger to smaller acts.\nAlso as a disclaimer, I love and appreciate all the bands and artists listed below (except Young Thug). These are just my lame opinions. So without further ado here is my picks:\nExceeded My Expectations #Tame Impala #Tame Impala was the ultimate headliner as far as I’m concerned when I went to Firefly festival in September of 2021. Now, was I sober for Tame Impala while at a festival in the woods? That fact may have swayed my opinion here for sure, but alas Kevin grabbed my mind’s eye whether I liked it or not. Before I forget, I must say that their light show was 100% the best I’ve ever seen, and I would argue the best in the world. There was this giant floating circle ring that played above the band the entire time, and it fired lasers above the crowd that I assumed were blasting into outer space. I couldn’t believe that they were playing all the music live as I was totally convinced that they were lip syncing the music. That’s how spot on it sounded. I completely lost myself in their music, playing air guitar for “Let it Happen” and loving how I bonded with the strangers around me as we all sang the lyrics and danced together. Tame Impala is a must see before you die. I hope I get to see them again in a festival setting like that.\nGlass Animals #So these blokes actually played before Tame Impala at the same festival. Their music still means a lot to me and at the time I was very into them. How to Be a Human Being is still one of my favorite albums of all time. I think their style of making pop songs with their use of percussion is some of the best in the business. So yeah, I was very excited to see them live. I remember being squished way in front just to the right of the stage. It was a long night at that festival and it seemed like they would never come out, but then they did, in what felt like an explosion. Wavey Davey ripped through all of the songs like it was nothing and I can just feel how excited they all were to be there. He has quite the voice. I felt the whole crowd light up with anticipation for each song. And the cherry on top was that they brought out Denzel Curry to sing Tokyo Drifting with them. What more could I have wanted at that time in my life?\nCage the Elephant #Let me just say, Cage the Elephant are a group of absolute rockstars. They were also a headliner at Firefly festival and with the combination of their raw energy, Matt Shultz’s stage presence, and a crowd that knew their songs, they earned their spot as one of the bands that exceeded my expectations. They know exactly how to put on a rock show, and they executed on that more than perfectly, with a guitar smashing at the end of the show to boot.\nUnwound #My bandmate Mike always had a deep love for this band that took me a while to understand. If I can go back in time I would make sure Unwound was known about and praised to the level Nirvana, Soundgarden, and other Washington bands were at that time. At the time I saw them I liked a few of their songs, after all we covered “Envelope”, but when I saw them in Philly a little while ago I got way more than I ever expected. These guys did not let their age show at all, and knew exactly how to channel the seasoned veterans inside of themselves when they played live. Unwound has a lot of energy packed into their music, and the fact that 30 years later they’re still able to convey that is a blessing. Sara Lund and Justin Trosper fucking rock. RIP Vern.\nSquid #This band caught my attention back in 2021 with their album Bright Green Field and I’ve been obsessed ever since. Always eagerly awaiting any crumb of new music they drop. I love their music, their visuals, their message, their energy, and so much more. However when it was finally time to see them at Union Transfer, I was a little worried. Squid is a 5 piece band with a lot of sounds going on, so I was concerned that they wouldn’t be able to capture that sound live. I had high expectations of them, and their music certainly gets complicated. Thankfully my worries were squashed, and my mind melted at that show as I lost myself in the pit screaming every lyric to every song. They played all my favorites and brought me into their world so far that I forgot who I was that evening. They did for me what I hoped they would do and then some.\nJulie #If you follow this blog you know I don\u0026rsquo;t shut up about this band. I already knew what to expect when I saw them at Brooklyn Bowl, but seeing them at Ukie Club the first time was a sight of pure destruction. Their presence and their energy matched the music perfectly. Even though I was somewhat sick and stood off to the side for this show, beholding the powerhouse that is Julie got me doing backflips in my mind.\nAnnie DiRusso #I saw Annie DiRusso open for Declan Mckenna in D.C. I didn’t have much expectations, except that she was opening for my beloved British lad. So she must have something to say. What I got was some truly authentic and personal songwriting with melodies to match. I really really felt her emotions, and thank god the venue had good sound because I was able to hear everything she said. She also did this cool technique with the microphone where she screamed and shook her head back and forth to create this sort of vibrato effect. Just a super freaking solid act.\nGodcaster #I saw Godcaster at Johnny Brenda’s and heard good things about them. I’m not sure if I checked out their music before or after, but they absolutely were a pleasant surprise to see live. The people I went with (some Wallace, Tonight homies) were excited to see Grocer, who was the opening act. Grocer, who is worth checking out as well. When Godcaster started, I saw a show I did not expect at all. All of the sudden their shirtless lead singer was menacingly strutting towards me into the crowd with an acoustic guitar. It reminded me of being scared by ghouls and goblins on the haunted hayrides I went on as a kid. Only this was genuinely a little scarier, as I had no idea what he would do. Their music was unique to me at the time, and I highly recommend listening to their self-titled album. Godcaster. The drawn out buildups into crescendos, their large and talented ensemble, and the piercing vocal chops on all the singers, ultimately showed me that Godcaster is in their own lane. I love the Diamond\u0026rsquo;s Shining Face music video.\nPalomino Blond #I got to see this Florida band at MiniMart in West Philly. I might admit that all the expectations I had of them was that they got on this bill because they had some roots with Her New Knife. But wow, and holy crap! What I love about this venue is that there is a second level that allows you to view the bands from above. I decided to go up there for this show and it was such a treat. They were all exceptionally talented, but their drummer blew me away to another world as their chops captivated me on a spiritual level.\nBuice #Buice, pronounced “Bised”, are the experimental noise homies from Atlanta. We were fortunate enough to play with them on their most recent tour at Stupid Baby’s. I listened to their record One Day You’ll See The Sun a few times before we played with them and the way they brought this record to life was music to my ears. Literally. I remember I didn’t want their set to end. If you check them out, make sure to check out their guitarist’s Jack’s other band Strumbrush while you\u0026rsquo;re at it.\nGumby’s Junk #Yeah I haven’t seen too many acts like this before. This three piece played with the one and only Mormon Toaster Head last October at the 700, and boy am I glad I got to see them. They were a pre-rehearsed masterpiece. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t tell what time signature they were in the whole time as I’m positive it changed bar to bar. I loved their synthy sounding tone choices as well. If you have ADHD, you’ll love this band. If they ever come to the east coast again they are a must see. I hope they keep at it. Also bonus points for having Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes on their merch.\nDidn’t Meet My Expectations #The Strokes #Don’t get me wrong, I love the Strokes. Like, a lot. They are in fact one of my favorite bands of all time. What I was let down the most by their set was the fact that they only played two songs off of their new album, which is one of my favorite albums of all time, The New Abnormal. And no, one of those songs was not my most favorite at the time, “Ode to the Mets”. Of course they aren’t going to play exactly what I’d like to, but only two?! Really !? On top of that they played at a baseball stadium. They played at a baseball stadium and didn’t play “Ode to the Mets”? Shake my head fr. I was unfortunately unfamiliar with the other songs they chose to play at the time. Julian Casablancas also seemed so beat, likely because he was. Where I cut them some slack is the fact that they weren’t the headlining act. This wasn’t their tour. No, that went to the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Who absolutely killed it, like I knew they would. Thundercat also played and I learned very quickly that I was sleeping on him as he was popping off. One last thing I’ll add is that I was in the nose bleeds for this show, so maybe a better spot would have made all of it better.\nDominic Fike #I saw Dominic Fike at the Firefly festival in Dover, DE. And yes at the time I was very into him as a junior in college. I saw him perform that song “Photo ID” together with Remi Wolf and that was very much awesome. I will forever cherish that as one of my favorite concert moments of all time, however his own set was a bit underwhelming and lackluster. I don’t know what drugs or drinks he was on, but he seemed out of it. The popularity of his songs let the crowd do a lot of the heavy lifting and although I think he has a lot of talent, this was a rough one for playing one of the biggest stages at a festival.\nKid Cudi #I decided to see Kid Cudi at Wells Fargo Center. I actually liked some of his newer stuff at the time. Seeing him was important to me because listening to Man on the Moon in 8th grade opened up my world of music and experiencing it. It made me musically sentient, and made me begin to seek out music I liked and not just listen to whatever the radio fed me. He made me feel and enjoy music like no one else did. I would listen to “Day N Nite” and “Pursuit of Happiness” religiously as well as some other oldies of his. I’m certainly older than I was in 8th grade, so seeing him live in 2022 told me that I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have expected what middle school me thought I\u0026rsquo;d get.\nYoung Thug #Although I didn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily have expectations for Young Thug, I did not expect him to unimpress me to the level he did. I figured he might be a “if you know you know” kind of artist. Specifically with knowing what he’s saying. I know he’s pioneered to a degree the vocally centered vocal styles in modern rap music, but he did the same hand movements and didn’t leave the center of the stage the whole time. He stayed at the mic, and did not match the energy I thought Jaden Smith had before him, and J. Cole did after him. This was one of the first concerts I’ve ever seen. It was at Penn State\u0026rsquo;s Bryce Jordan Center. It was in 2018. I didn’t like him then, and I still don’t like him now.\nJean Dawson #This can most likely be summarized by the fact that I haven’t been into Jean Dawson’s new stuff as much as I am into his old. His album Pixel Bath helped me at a time in my life that was mentally rough. And if I were to make music at that time, I thoroughly believe it would’ve sounded like him. I got some comp tickets for his recent show at the TLA for his tour of his new album and to be direct and honest, I think I’ve just outgrown his music. His new stuff has not clicked for me. Despite perhaps having the usual themes of his, the energy feels like it was taken down a notch. He’s not in the same artistic era I know him from. He’s at a different point in his journey. He\u0026rsquo;s on a different path now. People change, as they should. I just hope he’s doing what he truly wants. I’d still make music with him in a heartbeat.\nSpirit of the Beehive #I saw them packed onto a little stage at Johnny Brenda’s not too long ago. Sometimes popular bands have one off shows at smaller local venues so that they can work out any kinks for when they play larger shows. I believe this might have been that. They were very professional, and I was impressed with all their individual setups and instrument swappings. I might be wrong, but I am pretty sure there were 6 of them on the stage. Which is cutting it close at Johnny Brenda’s, especially if you have as many instruments as they did. Overall I\u0026rsquo;m down to blame my expectations not being met on the venue as I think they were not able to mix and handle the wide array of sounds which is Spirit of the Beehive. Ultimately it was still a good show. I loved hearing “THE DOOR IS CLOSING” live. Seeing them at what may have been the height of my obsession with them may also mean that I set the bar a little too high. I liked their new album YOU’LL HAVE TO LOSE SOMETHING, so go give it a listen if you haven’t already and so that they don\u0026rsquo;t hate me.\n","date":"17 November 2024","permalink":"/blog/2024/expectations/","section":"Blogs","summary":"As the title says.","title":"Concerts that exceeded my expectations, and concerts that didn't."},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/dominic-fike/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Dominic Fike"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/glass-animals/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Glass Animals"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/godcaster/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Godcaster"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/gumbys-junk/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Gumby's Junk"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/jean-dawson/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Jean Dawson"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/julie/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Julie"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/kid-cudi/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Kid Cudi"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/palomino-blond/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Palomino Blond"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/spirit-of-the-beehive/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Spirit of the Beehive"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/squid/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Squid"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/tame-impala/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tame Impala"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/the-strokes/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"The Strokes"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/unwound/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Unwound"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/young-thug/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Young Thug"},{"content":"10/25/24 #There is a rave tonight.

I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if I say the same thing next month.\nArt is important. The back of my mind has been pushing me to draw more recently although I am not too good at it. I mean I\u0026rsquo;m decent. I never have the patience to draw something well. I\u0026rsquo;ll start with one thing. Perhaps a chair. I start drawing it carefully. Then I get bored and start drawing other things. I draw them faster and faster taking less and less time on each one. Clearly showing me how my brain works and the lack of patience it has. Perhaps I could\u0026rsquo;ve been great. Drawing and painting was just something that I never really gravitated towards. I did a little bit, but not nearly as much as other things.\nI saw Julie with Her New Knife on Wednesday. I brought my fish eye lens and threw some of the live footage up on my YouTube. The lens just goes on the front of my iPhone. You can find them on Amazon.\nTonight I\u0026rsquo;m going to an art show curated and featuring my friend Dan Biederman. This dude is the guy. Does that make sense? Dan has been around quite a bit. I absolutely love his work. He curated this art show himself so I\u0026rsquo;m excited to see it. Dimmer is very likely going to have him make the artwork for our projects. Dan used to live one street behind me when we both went to Temple. We had a alot of mutuals, its kind of crazy. That\u0026rsquo;s the tea.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also decided that I would like to start intereviewing bands. I\u0026rsquo;m going to start with my homies and then work my way up. I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to do Static Brian and Wallace, Tonight! to start. Can\u0026rsquo;t wait to be the Philly Nardwuar.\nWell that was a short blog? Yeah I agree. Just trying to get back into it.\nI think I may have these blogs act as either journal entries or be actual pieces of journalism from now on. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to stop the mish mashing of both. People want the juice they\u0026rsquo;re looking for, not my bullshit. I mean I\u0026rsquo;ll still have my bullshit on here. But it will just be seperate.\n","date":"25 October 2024","permalink":"/blog/2024/ducks/","section":"Blogs","summary":"Getting ducks in a row.","title":"Ducks in a Row"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/journaling/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Journaling"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/work-hard/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Work Hard"},{"content":"8/31/24 Bare Minimum #Holy crap Lois. I\u0026rsquo;ve been suffering the effects of being chronically on the internet and staring at a screen for hours everyday since I was a child.\nI just listened to “I am Mothman\u0026quot; by Buice. Also I’m relistening to Census Designated by “Jane Remover”. I don’t know if I’m into the whole digicore thing, maybe I need to give it some relistens. I like the emotions pouring out. “I am Mothman” is an absolute crescendo of experimental noise and energy screaming out of Hayden and the rest. I just fucking love music. I can’t believe that anyone can make it at the level we do now. There has never been a better time to make music than right now. I think everyone should start doing as much as they can of whatever they want before A.I. ruins everything.\nI always feel so much more at peace when I’m doing something. I don’t have a good on and off switch for productivity. How I have operated for a very long time now is periods of either work mode or doing nothing. I always get burnt out inevitably, and then periods where I’m doing “nothing” is me doing the bare minimum. The “bare minimum” has changed over the years but at this point it\u0026rsquo;s in a good state. I am still committed to working out, and I’m still committed to music. But it’s not paying the bills, and I think this life of living out of touch with reality needs to come to an end. Or not that exactly. I am a hundred percent out of touch in a very self-aware manner. Or at least I\u0026rsquo;d like to think so.\nI took time to explore, travel, try new things, see what works, see what doesn’t, network. And I got things out of my system. I used to want to travel and see everything. Instead I decided I am more than grateful that I got to see the sights I got to see in my life as they’re incredible. I got to go to all kinds of places and countries, meet all kinds of people. But wherever you go, there you are. It\u0026rsquo;s time to lock myself in a room and “hone in on my ish” (The words of the great jasper.heart). A big house, money, health, those are all nice to have. But one must live a life of indifference towards these factors if one is to feel fulfilled everyday.\nPeople have different ideas of success. This is not my personal idea, but I think that the general population’s idea of success is gaining money (and maybe fame along with it), by pursuing wealth directly. If you are working hard at something, but money is the ultimate reason why, then you become a hollow shell of a person. (I am not talking about individuals who need to work a job they don’t like to pay the bills.) Narcissists are rewarded in our society, in fact it’s encouraged. Anything out of sight is out of mind in business, so it’s a job well done when you finally get all your company’s manufacturing moved offshore where people make your product(s) for slave wages.\nSometimes I feel like I’ve been nothing but a horrible person. I’ve been reconsidering getting an actual job again as I think that the job I had may have just been a uniquely aggravating one to me. Not all jobs are the same. No job is the same actually. Jane Remover is spitting.\nYou know I’d obviously rather become who I am and feel confident and sure of myself. I guess who wouldn’t? I want to put in the work, but it\u0026rsquo;s not like building legos. It\u0026rsquo;s not simple. You don’t stack bricks one at a time until it\u0026rsquo;s made. That’s how I\u0026rsquo;m always used to it being as schoolwork was always clear and linear. Instead it\u0026rsquo;s like jumping off a cliff. It’s all these giant leaps. Aches and pains and triumphs. You don’t even know if it\u0026rsquo;s the right cliff.\nWhen you question everything that you are, and realize you might not know who you are because of what you went through and how things are, well… You have to figure out what parts of you that you show are you, what parts of you aren’t, and what parts of you you’ve denied and kept hidden for so long. So long that you don’t even know what they are yet. You have to come from a place of complete acceptance and love for yourself. You, and everyone else, are the universe loving itself.\nI always get along with people who I feel intuitively are messed up. We all are. But I can sense when people are too hard on themselves. I’m definitely one of those people. I realized a long time ago that no one cares, I have to relearn this fact to myself again and again and again.\nI’m tired.\nI just reread everything I wrote and it\u0026rsquo;s like “ugh”. It\u0026rsquo;s good, it\u0026rsquo;s fine, it\u0026rsquo;s healthy. I\u0026rsquo;m fine. I just hope this doesn’t come across as an “everybody feel bad for me” thing. Feeling bad for yourself holds you back, but I think there is a line to cross where you don’t hold yourself back, and you end up becoming blind to the things you do wrong. I get worried about being ignorant and arrogant because a part of me tells myself that I’m the last person who would be.\n","date":"31 August 2024","permalink":"/blog/2024/bare-minimum/","section":"Blogs","summary":"General blog I guess.

I woke up at 6:30am and went. I was in Ocean City because I was on vacation with my family. I got back to our hotel and showered quickly, packed up, and then proceeded to Glen Mills, PA.\nIt was there I had a meeting with a modeling agency. I scheduled an appointment with a barbershop in the same plaza the agency had their office at. I had some downtime in between appointments so I walked over to the Hilton nearby to do some nomad work in their lobby. While I was in the lobby I did some work on my website. I wanted to fix some issues I had with it and I eventually fixed all of them. After all this it was about 6pm and at that point I headed to Swarthmore college as there was a show happening there. Cats on Mushrooms was playing with Supermarket Parking Lot and Prisoners of Love. They were all phenomenal to say the least. I got to hop up on stage and sang Head in the Ceiling Fan with Matt.\nI snapped a few pics and talked to the owner of the venue. It\u0026rsquo;s called Warehouse 3. I made a new page on the Philly Scene site for it.\nI drove home.\nFriday was a similarly busy day that I don’t feel like explaining in detail. Very busy. Doing very different things. There were some coaching calls, one of which opened my eyes.\nIt was only after this call where I unraveled and broke down and questioned, “What do I actually want out of life? What do I actually want to do? Why am I doing all these things and what are my expectations?”\nWhat led me to getting a coaching call where I was going to pay some dude to help me with what I already know how to do? Why did I think I needed him? What did I think he could give me?\n(I also saw Milly and Fiddlehead Saturday the 27th. Or at least I went to that concert for those bands specifically. Soul Blind and Gel were a pleasant suprise.)\n8/23/2024 Epiphanies #Anyways, about that epiphany… I did have it, and I have had yet another one recently. I have realized that in order to fit in my whole life, in order to survive the psychological wargames of social hierarchies and socialization in general, I have to put on a show of sorts. I do things just to \u0026ldquo;get by\u0026rdquo; in social situations rather than just be myself. Everyone does to an extent. But I feel I lack the same instilled reactions others have. It takes more energy and focus. Sometimes I think I don’t have all of the typical unconscious and automatic reactions others have to things.\nWhile I was in Colorado last week, I decided to partake in some of the state’s finest edible delicacies. For the last ten years of my life I have been around things containing THC, and people that consume it. And for the most part, except for when I’m alone, I get super freaking paranoid. I go non-verbal often. And I did in CO. I am suddenly trying to be aware of every little interaction. I am scared of being perceived. Thoughts of the future cripple me with paranoia. I become aware of far too much.\nTo be honest with myself here, I feel that I hid a lot of parts of myself as I got older. I stopped letting them come out, and I stopped expressing myself in ways I used to. I kept niche interests to myself. I loved making videos as a kid, I loved to sing, I loved to perform, but as I got older I got too self-conscious of these things and buried them out of fear of judgement.\nEver since Colorado, everything in my life has started to make sense. I realized, and thoroughly believe to an extent, that I am not \u0026ldquo;neurotypical\u0026rdquo;. Most people say, “Yeah, everybody is on the spectrum to some degree.” I have always believed this and believed I was, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t care what degree. I didn\u0026rsquo;t care to know or let it change how I see myself. However upon some further research and consideration knowing who I am, and what I’ve done, and how I’ve experienced the world, that it\u0026rsquo;s a more educated understanding to think that I’m more neurodivergent than I’ve led myself to believe? I don\u0026rsquo;t know what it is exactly, but I think there is more to acknowledge about my mental health that will lead to beneficial changes.\nI now have more clarity and can be more accommodating to myself than ever before. I can start getting better at being myself.\nI guess I won’t get into too many specifics about myself. It is a taboo subject, and a part of me doesn’t feel right to self-diagnose myself. Especially publicly. I acknowledge that there are people, for example with autism, who can’t even talk at all. I\u0026rsquo;m nowhere close to that, but I\u0026rsquo;ll hopefully go get an official diagnosis sometime soon.\nUPDATE: 12/13/24 I have anxiety ;)\nWhen I was a kid I played with action figures. I played with them a lot. But it would be so much more than that. There would be full narratives, character arcs, season long conflicts, and so much more. I would be able to see everything happening in my head so clearly, all I’d need is the figurines. As far as I’m concerned I’ve written and directed and did sound for hundreds of films and TV shows in my head, and I think that’s pretty cool. It’s why I hope to finally make more videos, and more music too.\nI’ve always had similar abilities to create music in my head in a very vivid way. But without the confidence or ability to play I never got into it until I picked up a guitar three years ago.\nI know myself enough to truly consider the fact that my mind has some corrupt software and this has been the sneaky thing in my life I’ve been trying to identify. The thing that is still making me feel like something is wrong. However I’m not buying shirts, telling everyone I meet about it, and making it my whole personality. I would just like to acknowledge it, here and now, as it has provided me with a lot of clarity and I can hopefully be much more accommodating and understanding to myself going forward. Mental health is a real thing and in the modern world it\u0026rsquo;s never been harder if you\u0026rsquo;re not healthy in the noggin.\nSo to tie this in with that coaching call, and my present day actions, I realized that I will never be who I thought I was ultimately going to be. I mean I believe I could do anything I set my mind to, but if I kept on the current track I would end up hating my life. I believe I am capable of anything, so I thought I had this obligation to get as much money and power as possible. To help my family, and to be one of the forces of good in the sphere of rich individuals. I think most people with immense wealth and power believes that they are the lesser of the other evils around them. If I weren’t the greedy and corrupt billionaire, then another person, more corrupt and more greedy will take my place, so I must retain my position at all costs. This belief, as I’ve come to realize, is utter bullshit.\nPursuing money for money itself will leave you completely empty. You will keep leveling up in an environment that is not based on true human connections. It\u0026rsquo;s based on money. You’ll give into impulsive pleasures once money is not a problem. For the most part, I think losing touch with reality, becoming blinded by privilege, and putting business before everything else is the inevitable outcome for any human that goes all in on this path.\nI don’t think there is any foolproof way to generate money in an ethical way. Not in this day and age. In every business model, at some point, you are ripping off the client. This is not only known, but encouraged and perhaps the problem that started it all. The idea is that extra money one makes is set aside so they could live comfortably and put their money towards other businesses. With greed instilled in us, the narcissists of this world will especially take advantage of this as far as they can.\nI’m getting a little off track. If you are passionate about your business, then good for you, I’m not trying to dissuade individuals from the grind. I’ve met entrepreneurs with pure intentions. I’m trying to say that it\u0026rsquo;s not natural, so don’t get too caught up in it. Don’t do it for money alone because it will not alleviate any personal problems except for financial ones. Often it doesn\u0026rsquo;t even do that. Most businesses fail.\nThis was my great epiphany, or my great epiphanies I should say. Combining them has made me tunnel visioned to pursue the stuff I am actually passionate about rather than what I think is most practical. I do it for those who would kill to be in my position. People are rooting for you. The universe is rooting for you to make the best choices for yourself and everyone else alike.\nUltimately, my overarching self-narrative about gaining power and money because I’m obligated to fight in the higher arena of good vs. evil is well… crazy. I thought that because I can get to the same level of the true elite in this world that I must do so so that I may make a difference. Fight against evil. Defeat the bad guys. I guess by becoming them? That doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound good. It sounds so delusional and absurd to type out, but it\u0026rsquo;s true. As if the world has ever been black and white… I was always a dreamer.\nNow, I think things are just going to run their course. No one is to blame. If something happens, that means that it was always possible. We can all try to prevent catastrophe. We can keep manipulating our environmenton earth, but the sun is still going to explode. I will sacrifice my life for my soul’s purpose and if everyone else did that, maybe we’d be at peace. Sounds like I’m a hippie I guess?\nI’ve never felt more at peace with myself than I have in the past week. I’ve felt like I\u0026rsquo;ve finally gotten over the curve I’ve been stuck on and can start making actual progress. Thank you Colorado lol.\nSucceeding in modern business is gross to me. The business of modern capitalism is unethical and based around corrupted fiat currencies. So until the world from my blockchain fantasies comes to fruition with its perfect, secure, decentralized, and global digital currency, my advice is to sit back and enjoy the ride. Stop wanting a million times more than what you have now. It’ll take away your gratitude. Desire better tires on your vehicle, not a sports car. If you pursue a path that has pure intentions and is inline with who you are, when you get fortunes you never thought you would have, you won\u0026rsquo;t even care much about them anymore.\nI’m not positive the world can continue the way it’s going. I give my life to music and the arts. I give my life to the culture. I inspire others and I hope to be more dramatic and assertive about my convictions. When the time comes I will change course. I will be grateful for the life of devotion I served before the storm comes. I’m sure it will come within my lifetime.\n","date":"23 August 2024","permalink":"/blog/2024/thursday-friday/","section":"Blogs","summary":"Two epiphanies come together to make me stop and realize I\u0026rsquo;m not going to be that entrepreneur-bro-sigma-male-grindset.","title":"My Thursday Friday \u0026 Ephiphanies"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/dimmer/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Dimmer"},{"content":"6/16/23 Nose Update #Dang fam, it\u0026rsquo;s been a while. I’ve been pretty busy since I quit my job.\nI’ve been back home in my hometown of Scranton, PA. I went and sang a Title Fight cover down at the Hyperview sign.\n6/18/23 Lil Buddy #Sometime soon I’m going to finally put this blog on my website for all to see.\nI have anxiety about these Instagram reels I made. I made rants where I just ramble my thoughts out loud to my phone after the gym. The anxiety I’ve gotten from posting them has been pretty wild. I try to see it as interesting, and look at it with objective curiousity. I made them mostly for myself as a personal experiment. I’ve gained insight into myself. And I’ve made progress with this fear of the online perception of myself. I don\u0026rsquo;t want any more energy going towards preserving my online persona. Whatever the heck that is. With the reels, I set the bar low on purpose. I just want to get better at making what I want.\nSince I’ve been home I’ve hung out with Albert Kausmeyer quite a bit. He’s in two bands here in Scranton. Pollen, and Bullied by The Elderly. Pollen is a Scranton super group. Their bassist is in All Day Special. Their songwriter and guitarist Caleb was in a different band back in Texas where he’s from. And their drummer, Ian, is in Channel 65. I love them all.\nI made a video for Channel 65 and their song “Lil Buddy” and it came out perfect! I seriously haven\u0026rsquo;t gotten sick of it. It nails the vibe we were going for. Go watch it: Albert recorded the music for “Lil Buddy” at his home studio, which I had the pleasure of seeing yesterday. It was like an oasis of instruments and microphones and interfaces. I always love seeing the Scarlett 18i20. It was clear to me when I saw his home studio that Albert is a league above me as far as gear knowledge goes. I don’t know the first thing about recording to be honest, except that experimentation is key. I heard that a one inch misplacement of a microphone is more noticeable than it being changed from analog to digital. So get freaky with your gear and your recording equipment. Maybe Dimmer will record at his house. We’ll have to wait and see. I know that I want Dimmer to sound really full and mixed and mastered well. While still remaining rough around the edges. I feel like if an audio engineer in a studio heard me say that they’d roll their eyes.\nI’m trying to work on my own project soon. I want to have something that is all mine. Obviously I want to be open to suggestions but I want full creative control. I’m a performer at heart. And I have a lot of personal stuff to express. I was going to revive the name “2Long”, but I don’t want to run another social media account. “2Long” might be the name of the album. The thought of having to yet another ig account is nauseating.\nIt really is peaceful back home though. I wish I was doing more fun things with other adolescent folk. Everybody I know works like a dog. Especially back home. No young people I know have both the time and money to do fun stuff. I think maybe they lost the attitude to have real fun as well.\nI hate worrying about money. Sometimes this world makes me absolutely sick, but I’m so thankful for my friends and family.\nI think I narrowed down what I want to do with my life for the foreseeable future. I’ll keep you posted.\n6/21/24 More Shows #The news happens to be on as I’m writing this. It\u0026rsquo;s saying how Louisiana and Texas are putting the Ten Commandments in every classroom. What a slippery slope that seems to be.\nI just put a deposit down to have a show and vendor festival at St. Mary’s Center in Scranton. Kayla Grezch has been helping me a lot as she is more familiar with the diy scene in Scranton than I am. She\u0026rsquo;s got the knack for making nice things to look at as well. Dimmer just got our housing situation settled for our Penn State show July 13th. We\u0026rsquo;re playing Penn State Fest. The glorious Bennett Hamilton is hopping on bass. Also Benji and Mike and Prim (Chicago Fire) are playing with Sun Organ and Fib at Cousin Danny’s. There’s also some Asheville bands on the bill I’m excited to hear as well. I’m excited for that show so I hope it\u0026rsquo;s swag money. I saw Sun Organ not too long ago at Love City Brewing, but I didn’t get a chance to talk to Tim. I’m a big fan of Sun Organ, and I love its production. Fib too. If you’re signed to Jwar, there is a good chance I’m a fan.\n6/24/24 Windy Website Work #It was windy today. Like windy as a curse word. I’m still back in Scranton. I finally started real work on my website today. It uses Hugo and I am slowly starting to learn how to use it. Hugo is a static website generator that uses Go to be lightning fast. My friend Jay Rush uses it for Trueblocks.io and Jeff used it for the Philly Scene site.\nI’m hoping to finally get all these blogs onto my website. I think the other stuff will change overtime but the blog will be consistent and I’ll have tags so you the reader can parse through my nonsense a little bit. I have a lot to read but I am excited to go through all my posts and see how different my headspace and daily activities looked compared to now.\n6/28/24 Shady’s back #Yo check it out I can insert code markup right onto the blog! Here’s the Hugo command I use to generate a new blog post:\nhugo new blog/2023/julie-work/index.md I’m back in the wonderful city of Philadelphia and I’ll admit that things felt right almost instantly. Back home feels so slow compared to my life here and I’m not saying one is better than the other, but I feel so much more right to be in the city. I\u0026rsquo;m a city slicker.\nI went to Philamoca two days ago to see Teethe, People I Love, and 22° Halo. These bands fit really well together on this bill. There were no mosh pits. Which was very surprising. I want to try and talk about bands after I see them live. This show was one of those shows where I like to find a good spot in the venue so I can hear the sound the best. I then close my eyes and let the music take me aways. All of these bands are perfect for that. I recommend all of them if you’re trying to get into more somber, melancholy, and thematic music.\nThe influence that came to mind when I listened to Teethe for the first time was the band Duster. The way they ride out the melodies and add vocal harmonies with it are magical. God, I feel like Fantano. If you connect with it, its fantastic. I recommend their self-titled.\nPeople I Love is creatively steered the most I believe by Dan from the acts Waveform* and Lola Star. There seems to be a posse of musicians from these three bands (Waveform*, People I Love, and Lola Star) who collaborate together. To the extent I don’t know, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s fair to say given their drummer Avery plays for all three bands. I binged as many People I Love songs as I could before the show. And they were great to hear live. I think the songs are a bit zany, in a good way, but I personally like the lyrics and unique production the most.\n22° Halo is a band I was put onto a while ago, and their soft music was just what I needed at the time. Its soft and nice. Listening to them live brought me to a happy quiet place. This band is a vibe in their own right and I hope Will Kennedy and the rest of them can keep making stuff and stay in the Philly scene as time goes on. I saw them before at Mini Mart, standing on the balcony above them, but this time on the ground level it felt more intimate.\nThat specific Mini Mart show was also where I met Sebastian from Bedridden, who was also at this show at Philamoca. We complained about back pain from standing too long, which is a tall person problem nobody talks about.\nAlso, did you try out the light mode for the website?

I quit my job. I need to make money. I’m either going big or going home. Everything feels a lot more dramatic now. Because I’m trying to be very decisive about what I’m doing with every second of my day. I’ve even wondered if this blog is worth it? At the time of writing this I still have not released it anywhere. No one knows it exists except me. I think I hope that people can find this one day and see it as inspiring. My soul wants to express itself. I’m finally trying to allow that to happen.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s funny as I start this journey it feels like my life has just started. It feels like everything I’ve done in school and college has largely been a waste, and I would have been better off partying. I could’ve expanded my network more. As I start this journey I also feel misunderstood. I can already tell that this is a lonesome path. For a while, it will be an individual journey. I think there is some truth to that quote “lonely at the top,\u0026quot; but I don’t like the words “at the top”. Because I feel like that implies that someone at the “top” is above all others. I hear the label “successful entrepreneur”, and my mind quickly turns that label into “money-hungry sociopath”. How else would someone acquire immense wealth at such a young age? Maybe I’ve been brainwashed. Is every person interested in business filled with the spiritual ignorance I sense? To what degree?\nI’ve been growing up with so many people around me saying capitalism is bad. And all I want to say about that, at this moment, is that this thinking has made me think the world is bad. That the world we live in is the worst and is going to end in tragedy. How even if I gave a homeless person some food, that I am still perpetuating the system that keeps them there. Which in that case I objectivley would be. I don’t know what the truest words are to describe our reality, but I know that with the short time I have on this earth I don’t want to have any existential ideas cemented in my head that bring me anxiety, depression, and a sense of hopelessness. It\u0026rsquo;s too short to ever think otherwise. And that’s not ignorant, that’s just logical. I’ve come to a new way of thinking, hopefully not to justify my endeavors of the next few months, but I have to obtain power in the current system we have as well as understand it if I want to change it. We won’t change from capitalism to communism overnight or to any other form of government. If it does happen over night then it won’t be for the better. Instead it must be a gradual transition. And that’s why I hang on tightly to my blockchain governance fantasies. A perfect indisputable currency and voting system where everyone can participate. Or am I daydreaming too much?\n2/6/24 I’m Anxious #In my senior year of college, I have felt what I think was the early stages of a panic attack. It happened for no apparent reason, and always happened in class. All of the sudden I just felt like something overwhelming was about to happen. Panic attacks essentially are a feedback loop where you get anxiety about how much anxiety you\u0026rsquo;re feeling and it just skyrockets until your system implodes.\nI’m feeling pretty anxious today. I’m blaming some of it on my horrible sleep schedule. (I slept from 6 am to 9:30 today.) But I also get these bouts of it although it has been getting better. I think I’ve pushed stuff to the side for now in my mind. I don’t want to get hung up on old worries anymore. I don’t want these unconscious social hierarchies to be in my way, but yet I still feel like I don’t know my place. I clearly have a lot going on inside me. Sometimes it slows me down. It stops me in my tracks. I’ve done the therapy. I’ve found great outlets but it still persists. And I don’t know what will come of it. Perhaps a panic attack will come. The point is that I’m at a point where I don’t care what happens. I’m ready to embrace the panic attack. I’m ready to fail. To be seen failing. To be embarrassed. To be perceived. I don’t have any time to waste anymore. I want to go on and get living.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been working out every morning and meal prepping, making music and trying to committ to many different things. I’m trying to start and stay consistent with a YouTube channel, I’m trying to do the same with another YouTube channel, I’m trying to get into Blockchain, I thought about trying stand up comedy, I’m trying to make a personal website for this blog.\nI’m trying to do too much. I want to do it all. I’m at a point in my life where I have limitless possibilities. But I need to choose only a few. And I need to commit to them completely.\nI can do anything, but I can’t do everything.\n","date":"3 February 2024","permalink":"/blog/2024/quit-job/","section":"Blogs","summary":"I finally quit my job.

I finally put in my 2 weeks at my corporate job. My last day is next Friday. Today is Thursday. I am going to genuinely pursue about 10 different businesses if I’m guessing correctly. All of various sorts. I’m not even counting the music as part of it. (Side note: I\u0026rsquo;m upset I missed Wednesday and Echotracer and Hotline TNT at Union Transfer.)\nHere’s a YouTube rant video I made about my job and quitting it:\nI really need to get my PC working and my Wi-Fi working. I have just been really intimidated by it. It\u0026rsquo;s a combination of the Wi-Fi and my own PC’s nonsense that is causing this to happen. My bandmates said they’ll help me. My roommate has already been battling with Comcast. I need to buy Adobe Premiere Pro and maybe photoshop and definitely a nice camera. I’ll see if they have a bundle. I also bought a bass and studio monitors this month. The studio monitors I have were claimed to be the ones used to produce the original Kidz Bop albums. Or at least some of them. I don\u0026rsquo;t know officially, but I believe the guy I bought them off because why not?\nMy old friend from highschool, Samuel Morgan, is now my personal trainer. He’s a little more than that though. He’s a special soul and a beacon of positivity and faith. So I think it will work out perfectly. I’m ready to put in the work at the gym when I quit my job. I cannot wait.\nuncl3slam on IG.\nI won’t explicitly say my finances, but I saved up, and I’m hoping it lasts me at least until next year in Philly. People look at me in disbelief when they hear that I don’t have another job lined up. But I really really don’t care. This is not what I signed up for when I put the past 16 years of my life into academia!? I didn\u0026rsquo;t work this hard to get what I feel is absolutely no where near where I want to be. Where I think I could be. These people don’t know me. And the people who have done the same and failed, also aren’t me. You have to have some insanity when you quit your job and pursue your silly little dreams like me. Or at least be somewhat aware of it, which I think am.\nIt is insane. I do think this is a privileged opportunity, but that is no reason to stop myself. I have been dealt a good hand, and I shall not waste it.\nI have definitely become more business minded. I’ve always hated the ethos surrounding the word “entrepreneur”. When I hear that I think of a sociopathic business student who’s already rich off of old money but wants even more. I’ve been calling myself an entrepreneur, but I’ve been redefining what it means for myself. I think that I am in a unique situation where I have a supportive family to fall back on, many close friendships, a strong intellect, my physical health and adolescence, a cesspool of ideas and passions to pursue in my head, and so much more. So mine as well try and fail than not try at all. People say to wait and plan, but that costs me invaluable time. There is no right time. As I pursue my goals I have to stay focused on myself, and I have to remind myself that this is not a selfish way to live. Because one day I am plan to provide for my friends and family with the success I find. For my community at that time. I just am. And hopefully further down the line I can have enough assets to actually make a positive change in this world.\nBut until that happens, I have to participate and figure out how to survive in this twisted game of green paper and digital numbers. Or also unfortunately known as “reality”.\nWish me luck.\n","date":"18 January 2024","permalink":"/blog/2024/leaving-my-job/","section":"Blogs","summary":"How I\u0026rsquo;m reorientating myself, quitting my job, and my You Tube rant about it.","title":"2 weeks"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/wednesday/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Wednesday"},{"content":"12/1/2023 My YT Premiere #The YouTube video I made is premiering today at noon, but I don’t really care to hear what people say about this video. I’m not really proud of it in the way I’ll be proud of future videos. I made and edited it in about an hour. I’m excited to make more videos, but this one was just to get me started. It\u0026rsquo;s just me nervously talking into a camera, and I’m proud of myself for that.\nI have a lot to say. I don\u0026rsquo;t know exactly what my videos will become. I’m just going to go with the flow to the best of my ability. A YouTube channel that’s just whatever. I think of Sam Selek and how I wish I hopped on this wave sooner.\nI think that YouTube is kind of splitting off into a literal red-pill and blue-pill place. Sam Selek and Mr. Beast are kind of the opposite ends of this spectrum. I kind of hate that I used red-pill and blue-pill to describe it, but Mr. Beast is like candy, and Sam Salek is like a nice home cooked meal. I’m not saying either one of them is better than the other. I love both of them. Mr. Beast is like Times Square, and Sam Salek is like an isolative farm in Nebraska.\nContent has gotten too saturated and honestly annoying. I won’t write an essay right now, but YouTube is not the same. I actually touched on this in my video, but I think we need to get back to reality. We need more videos of people just being people. And that’s what Sam Salek does well. I don’t think people are even there for the workout advice as much as they are the down to earth inspirational vibes he gives off.\nExercise is kind of a cure all solution in my book. We weren’t meant to be sitting down all day doing little physical motion. It\u0026rsquo;s bullshit. Get the endorphins pumping.

The physical and mental are one in the same in a lot of ways. If you want to be better and you feel down, I guarantee you that picking up some weights, or doing cardio will change that. You have to give it a real try though. I always say that two weeks of dedication is all you need to know if it is really working or not. More often than not when I see people pick up weights, they do not put them down.\n12/6/2023 X (twitter) #No, not ecstasy. X, formerly Twitter, is a platform I thought to thoroughly revisit last night. The last time I feel like I truly dabbled with Twitter was either freshman year of college, or sometime before. I hated it then, I don’t know why I thought it would be better now. It felt like a giant filthy stew of dogshit. Featuring the best and worst of humanity, sometimes one after the other. I saw the scum of the internet. People with egos and self-images so big they probably think they are God itself. I saw devastating headlines, as well as graphic videos of pornography, violence, and death.\nI’m probably exaggerating. There are probably controls I can set on my feed so I don’t see any NSFW content. I’m glad that the freedom on the platform can sometimes provide more accuracy to headlines, but there was too much nonsense for me to sift through.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s made me hate myself too. Because I couldn’t look away. It was so exhilarating and tragic that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop. Fear is one of our first emotions. When we are scared or shocked to our core by news, we automatically think that it is of the most importance. Not that people dying or stuff like that is something to gloss over, but my point is that we are wired to be drawn to that. The mainstream media knows it. When there is a war or conflict that the U.S. is somewhat attached to, that’s all we will see. There is a lot of money to be made in war. And they know it. That’s why they’ll make sure it\u0026rsquo;s your favorite show. They know you’ll think it\u0026rsquo;s of the utmost importance. Again, not that it isn’t important, but they know you’ll be hooked. The military industrial complex needs these news stories to sustain itself.\nI was on X for about an hour before bed last night and I felt physically ill. I felt overwhelmed. It felt like the closest you can get to playing GTA VI without actually playing it. It’s unfiltered chaos. It’s everything that humanity has to offer in its purest form. I may return and adjust my feed, but it won’t be for a while. We are a wild species.\nThe only time I will ever use Twitter, or X, is to catch up on what Tagabow had been saying. Or perhaps I’ll get sucked into crypto again. Overall, I’m scared of it, I\u0026rsquo;m not a fan but I understand its importance.\nEDIT: 7/02/2024 I have X (twitter) now. For crypto. So much for that rant.\n12/19/2023 Tagabow at First Unitarian Church # Full Body 2 at First Unitarian Church\nI saw one of my favorite shows to date last night. Tagabow\u0026rsquo;s last leg of tour at First Unitarian Church. A very legendary venue. Figuring out how to get in there felt like a Dark Souls map. That dude John from Julia’s War (not sure his name) tried to jip me $20 as a joke of course.\nThe two guys from SPIRIT OF THE BEEHIVE opened the show as their duo act called Draag Me. The pit went hard for TAGABOW. I participated. Overall, like I said this show was one of my favorites to date. Full Body 2 was great. I met some cool people. Some of the homies from Kicker were there. Ben’s glasses got broken in the pit, but they got fixed.\nUnraveling They Are Gutting A Body Of Water\u0026rsquo;s Blissful Universe\n“You learn everything from the mirrors of other people. You learn everything through other people. Just having friends is dope, it\u0026#39;s a blessing truly.\u0026#34; ~ Douglas Dulgarian 12/21/2023 Towed #My car got towed last night yay! I parked in a handicapped spot in Chinatown. Totally my fault but the fact that I had no idea where it went, the fact that the phone number on the sign wasn’t working, and the fact that it cost me $500 to get it back has made me decide to one day destroy the Philadelphia Parking Authority.\nA quick Google search made me see that they\u0026rsquo;re a force of pure evil. They are a private entity sucking money out of the hard-working people of Philadelphia. I’m not saying I should’ve parked in that spot. What I am saying is that if I was someone else I could’ve been completely screwed.\nI never condone parking in handicapped spots. I think people who do that are awful and think they are privileged. I was being an idiot. The sign had a lot of stuff on it. I was just excited because I was on my way to a meetup.\n","date":"1 December 2023","permalink":"/blog/2023/december-backlogs/","section":"Blogs","summary":"All of my December blogs rolled into one.

Transitioning from “new employee” work to “actual” work sucks for me because I’m too used to getting my hand held. You feel like you need to do more. Your managers act as a panopticon making you wonder if they\u0026rsquo;re going to walk by and see you not doing work. Or see you not at your desk. Or see you writing a blog complaining about work.\nThis job has scared me straight. I try to take my time here as a lesson. A lesson to hustle when I don’t work here anymore so I never have to work in a place like this again. I’m the only one of my friends who has a salaried job with benefits out of school. I don’t realize how good I have it. I feel sick today and don’t have enough PTO to take off work. But most of my friends don’t even know what PTO is. In a figurative sense of course. I have so much free time to learn new things. I pretty much taught myself guitar theory while working here and hopefully I’ll be able to pay off my loans sooner than I thought. There are good restaurants around for lunch. Commuting is manageable. I have some former colleagues here. I made some friends here who I see everyday. None of my coworkers are bad. Work is kind of easy. And yet…\nI want out. I feel lied to and betrayed by the system. All this extra time and work and energy into school for 16 years for me to land a random job. I didn\u0026rsquo;t need nearly 3/4 of what I learned in school to work here. Did I want this? Was this the light at the end of the tunnel? What else did I think would happen? I remember wanting a computer science degree so I can land a job and have enough time and money to do my hobbies on the side. And that’s basically what I have now. I wanted to travel more, but with my soul glued to underground music, and this job not being remote, I won’t be leaving anytime soon.\nThe thing that really gets me is something I put a higher price on everyday. And that is my time.\nWork takes my time. It takes it right away from me.\nExistential dread comes out of nowhere some days to push me to the ground and kick in my ribs. Make my heart ache. Make my anxiety skyrocket. Where was the class in school that addressed this daily problem? Oh, is it therapy? It\u0026rsquo;s just the fact that I don’t think my job does ANYTHING for the betterment of society and humanity as a whole.\nI could have hunted, killed, and dragged an animal back to the village so all my loved ones get to eat. I don’t even get a glimpse of the feelings I’d imagine that hunter version of me would have. My job, that I do everyday, feels completely pointless. And feeling that on a daily basis sucks.\n11/2/2023 Julie Aftermath \u0026amp; Artist Celebritisation # alantheg via IG\nMy bandmates are inspired after seeing Julie last night. Myself included. Talk about a phenomenal upcoming band. Great original sound, original aesthetic, and cool people. I stayed late after the show. Not on purpose, I got caught up talking to some homies outside the venue. I ended up meeting the band. I talked to them a bit. Tried to get their Spotifys to stalk, but they ended up being on their Discord. I talked to Alex and they signed my guitar pick. They told me they use the same pick for bass. My pick is somewhat thick for a guitarist I guess? I got a medium thick and sturdy pick after hearing advice from my metal guitarist friend JD. I always prefer them medium/thin and sturdy now. I almost exclusively use a 1.14mm pick.\nI can’t wait to cook.\nSomething funny and something I still don\u0026rsquo;t know how to deal with regarding the underground scene is that my favorite bands, my favorite artists, are often standing next to me in the crowd. Standing side by side at the urinals. They’re at the same show as me. It sounds stupid, I know they’re just people like me, but sometimes I celebritize them too much. It’s something I’m working on. I try my absolute hardest to talk to them like I met them on the street. Because that’s how people should be treated of course, how any new person should be treated. On a normal interaction I’m kind, courteous, and curious to people I meet for the first time. With all these upcoming artists around me I sometimes struggle not to be an absolute fanboy and act standoffish. Ultimately, I got some growing up to do…\nWhen you’re so deep into an artistic medium you develop an appreciation for new artists in the local scene that you find and like. And you can become obsessive. Or at least I can. In a way, a lot of the time, it\u0026rsquo;s almost like the art is personified in the human being that made it. Talking to the musician who made a song is like talking to the song itself. You’re talking to its conjurer. We’re all little Gods whenever we create stuff, and it’s fucking cool.\nWhen I talk to people sometimes I think, \u0026ldquo;Am I being rational? Or am I just not being confident? Am I forcing my presence on someone, or is their no playbook here?\u0026rdquo; You have to be careful with that word “should”. Everybody is different. I\u0026rsquo;m glad I\u0026rsquo;ve acknowledged this issue and can work on it.\nI’ve absorbed so much music and talked to so many artists. I figure that the solution is to work hard on your own stuff, and they\u0026rsquo;ll come to you.\n“No matter how isolated you are and how lonely you feel, if you do your work truly and conscientiously, unknown friends will come and seek you.” ~ Carl Jung I would really like to talk to Tyler, the Creator one day. But at this point in my life, I don’t think it would be right if I did? That’s like selling out Wells Fargo when you only wrote one song. It doesn’t feel right. He is a world reknown artist with over a decade of work. What do I have to show for him? It\u0026rsquo;s not that I am of less worth, but I feel I need a history of music, music videos, and/or other art to show for myself. I don’t like that I gate keep myself. No one ever should. I think the point I\u0026rsquo;m trying to get to is that if you want to talk to your idols, make it certain that they would want to talk to you.\n11/3/2023 The Creative Process Heals #I always have so much to say. Starting this blog has made me realize how much I have to say, and how I can effectively talk to myself. Writing out your thoughts will reveal all to you. Everything in your mind put onto paper is indisputable.\nI had a talk with my good friend Joycie last night about life and creativity. I wish I could see him more. We both work a lot, usually opposite schedules. He works at concert venues. He lets my band practice in his basement. I’ll gladly gas him up anytime.\nAnyways, we talked about how the creative process evolves and heals you as a person. How being an artist is therapeutic. We talked about Tyler, the Creator and Action Bronson and Dave Grohl and what they all have in common. A couple things I’ll list below:\nThey have started unapologetically doing what they want and liking what they like from a young age. They are passionate about everything in every moment, not just about art in the mediums they’ve found success in. They are grateful for life. They are completely themselves all the time. They have a large support system around them. They have great relationships with their mothers, and the women in their life. Joycie praised and showed gratitude for all the women in his life. I’m glad I’m going home to see my mom today.\nLater thoughts\u0026hellip;\nNow that college is finished, High School seems even more like a dream. I have very strange reactions when I think of some high school memories. I think it comes from over romanticizing it, nostalgia, pain, and feeling like it was another life. Because it kind of was for me, even though that sounds dramatic.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s just so surreal sometimes.\n11/5/2023 Charles Library #Working in the Charles Library because I’m trying to remember what it\u0026rsquo;s like to be a college student. Just kidding… but I\u0026rsquo;ll admit walking around campus feels bittersweet. It\u0026rsquo;s crazy how much of a different person I am with a different mindset compared to last May when I was graduating. A lot can happen in a year.\nI thought that once I got out of college I would have no more excuses for myself. At that point it\u0026rsquo;s just me vs. myself. Nothing is going to get in the way of what I want to do. In school the stress of grades and assignments meant it didn’t matter that I had free time. I had so much free time. And so many times I’d be tired and unproductive. Stress and anxiety and all that jazz.\nCleaning up my computer and iPhone right now. Doing that once in a while clears your head. I think it\u0026rsquo;s always good to clean before doing a more mentally exhaustive task. It’s like you\u0026rsquo;re warming up your brain.\n11/6/2023 Pixies #I’ve been listening to Doolittle. This album is divine. It’s like candy to my music mind. It\u0026rsquo;s so emotional and fun. It just is. Very inspiring. I’d love to sound like Black Francis. The songs are so layered and deep that I’m not getting sick of them. They have such a November vibe too.\nDimmer is trying to get our shit together so we can have new songs ready for the show December 2nd with the Monks. Or at least that’s what’s getting set up right now. Our friend Matt Perkins will hopefully play with us in his band “Cats on Mushrooms”. Name never gets old. I’m dying to play a show off campus at Temple. It\u0026rsquo;s a big reason I stuck around the university; much to my family\u0026rsquo;s objections.\nI don’t know how to lower my expectations of life right now. I have big dreams and I’m trying to achieve them. I’m trying to find an alternative to the job I have. But will I miss the present moment too much trying to pursue this creative and financial freedom? Escaping the matrix doesn’t exactly mean financial freedom to me. Although I’m not saying that wouldn’t help. Escaping the matrix is just enjoying your life and having enough time to pursue your hobbies. Enough time that you’re satisfied with. Maybe I’m still just desperate to feel special\u0026hellip; before this monkey’s gone to heaven.\nI want to convey all these weird and magical and strange and complex feelings I’ve had throughout my life. I don’t want to feel alone, I don’t want others to feel alone either. I want to relate. A lot of these feelings contain a lot of weight from mere existence itself, and they probably arise from the times I felt like I was the actual center of the universe. It\u0026rsquo;s powerful. The desire to express yourself becomes overwhelming when you realize you can go at any moment. Or at least, that\u0026rsquo;s how I feel.\n11/7/2023 Stress # gelehaas via Pinterest\nYou ever get so stressed and worried that it physically hurts? Your brain can’t think straight. You can’t find any rational thoughts. You figure out how you’re going to deal with your problems, but your conscience still wants to worry. You tell yourself like “Okay, when the time comes we’re going to do this.” And then it\u0026rsquo;s settled, it\u0026rsquo;s done. You decided what you’re going to do; what the best thing to do is. But still, your mind and body don\u0026rsquo;t have it. It\u0026rsquo;s still on alert. It is still stressed. You’re in panic mode. Just waiting for time to pass when the stress will inevitably go away.\nSomething that’s been messing with me lately is how we all just “think” we are alive. We think we\u0026rsquo;re special, and that things are things, but they’re not. Everything we see we just name. We’re just assigning specific sounds to things. All the parts of our anatomy aren’t actually what we call them. That’s not their name. We named them, and we’re not real. We just think we are. Am I making sense? Maybe not. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s too hard to explain.\nHow do we know this is the highest reality? Isn’t everything just an abstraction? Maybe it is all simulated. I think there is a lot of evidence to support that. Maybe God is trying to run simulations in the hopes of making another God to hang out with. I’m glad our bodies are pretty resilient, at least for most of us…\n\u0026#34;The universe is a cruel, uncaring void. The key to being happy isn\u0026#39;t a search for meaning. It\u0026#39;s to just keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense, and eventually, you\u0026#39;ll be dead.\u0026#34; ~ Mr. Peanutbutter 11/8/2023 Elan School \u0026amp; Dave Grohl #I made a resume today. For a security position at a local venue. The Met. If I get hired I get to just stand there and hear live music for free. And I get paid to do it? Sounds like a win win to me. My friend works at the Mann center. He swears on it being the best job of all time, or one of them. Experiences are priceless. They’re moments in time that you’re paying for. You’re paying to be present at a certain spot in space and time? I’d kill to work at music venues with the salary I do now. I don’t think that will ever happen though. I guess I’ll keep you posted. If you’re reading this… Why are you reading this?\nElan School:\nI finished elan school. Elan.school is a masterpiece, but I don’t think it\u0026rsquo;s right to call it that. Not that it isn’t a “masterpiece”, but it\u0026rsquo;s a story the creator never asked for. At least at the start of it. He wasn’t making this webcomic, graphic novel based on a fictional character that he feeds his own experience into. This was his experience. It\u0026rsquo;s an autobiography. And it just so happens to be one of the most incredible stories I’ve ever heard. It\u0026rsquo;s real. Do you know what the means?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s weird to feel like you know someone so intimately, yet never having met them. In Joe Nobody’s case (the creator of elan.school), I’ve never even seen his face. If I ever saw him though I think I might break down and sob. And I don’t think he’d even be weirded out by it. I think he’d get it. If I’m not making sense I don’t blame you. I’m not going to attempt to describe the story. Just go read it. I will be worth your time. It will inspire you, and I think that’s something Joe would love to know he provided.\nDave Grohl:\nThe only other person I feel like I have that deep connection with despite never meeting them is Dave Grohl. I was already fond of his music, but after reading his autobiography, The Storyteller, I realized I made a friend. This dude is someone who rocks, and I know that I will meet him one day. The universe has let me know, trust me. Don’t judge a book by its cover though, right? They say, “Don’t meet your idols”. Well in this case I read the book. He is the only person who I’ve taken a liking to their music and read their novel. The only exception is Will Smith. I read his autobiography right before the infamous slap. (That was so surreal.) Anyways Dave Grohl deserves all the hype for being true to himself and being genuine. He’s the biggest rockstar to me, even if he’s not topping the charts all the time anymore.\nEDIT 11.27.24: Dammit Dave cheated on his wife and had a kid outside his marriage. Don\u0026rsquo;t meet your idols.\nAlex G’s album DSU is becoming my favorite album of his.\n11/9/2023 Waveform \u0026amp; Wallace, Tonight # Juliette Boulay via bornloser.org\nShould I curse here? I love Waveform holy crap they’re so good. Just go listen. The articles I’ve read have articulated very well the emotions their music invokes, but I am also being lazy at the moment by not describing it myself. They’re signed to Run For Cover Records. I love so many of the other artists/bands signed to that label. Horse Jumper of Love, Turnover, Wicca Phase Springs Eternal… I’d love to sign to a label with an ethos like Run for Cover one day, but until then we be independent as fuck. I’m getting ahead of myself though. Got to release music first. Got a lot of stuff to do.\nDimmer Stuff:\nJeff was thinking of releasing some snippets on Soundcloud. This way people can hear what we sound like. Other than that I don’t think we will be releasing music for a while. We have 4 songs pretty much done at the moment that we like. Two other ones that are also done but we don’t like. Our band functions as a democracy best it can. So there you have it. Our secret is out. Dimmer is a democratic band.\nMaybe I really could start writing a book. I know it\u0026rsquo;s cringe to care about stuff but bear with me oh wise Buddha. Maybe I shouldn’t talk about stuff because if I get it all out of me in words, I won’t want to get it out of me so much in music anymore.\nI\u0026rsquo;m kidding of course. I think people on the internet are often bad with humor and sarcasm. I think I can be terrible at it sometimes. I used to think emojis were cringey for a long time but the fact is they’re super helpful. Our expressions and tones when we talk, all the little subtleties can change the context of something that is said. Like how you think I’m yelling right now! Wow, I’m such a David Foster Wallace genius over here talking about punctuation and being emotive in conversations!\nWallace, Tonight:\nFear and Loathing with Wallace this Friday! John sent me more Wallace, Tonight! recordings and demos. Thanks for the leaks, they are so very good. The members of Wallace, Tonight! are all masterful at what they do. I love Paul’s vocals a lot. Am I supposed to have been given those demos? Guys if you see this, don’t get mad at John. I won’t share the demos with anyone. The last of the three EPs is probably out by the time you’re reading this anyways.\n11/16/2023 Love those you love #“Memento Mori” is a latin phrase that I really live by. It means “remember you will die”. It sounds morbid at first. I found it because it was the slogan of the Austere Academy that the Baudelaire children stay at in the 5th book of Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events. What else would it be with an author like that guy?\nYou’re going to die. I always say death is the most neutral thing possible. One worries and thinks “Oh no, there’s nothing after death!” Who told you that \u0026ldquo;nothing\u0026rdquo; is bad? Nothing is nothing. It is perfectly gray. That’s not the point. I think for most of my life, I spent it not realizing that everything I see is made up. Not that reality isn’t real, but that everything we have isn’t a given. We don’t stop to contemplate about how much of our abilities aren’t a given. It feels like language is a given. It feels like food and water and shelter is a given. Often times our friends and health. I know it\u0026rsquo;s not the same for everyone, some people are dealt a bad hand that introduces them to reality at a young age, but some people go through their whole life completely blue-pilled.\nNot realizing that everything is a construct is bad for business. In a spiritual sense. Do you realize that all the math ever made can be chalked up to some wierd drawings? Or that language can just be called “specific noises”? Everything we experience in our head is stored in our biological computer. That’s where the world actually is in a sense. I’m sure you’ve heard a lot of this before. This wasn’t even the rant I thought I’d go on about with “memento mori”, but its important to remember.\nMotivational speech time. Make sure to buy my course after this.\nYou have one life. One body. If you lose an arm, it\u0026rsquo;s gone forever. Or at least it\u0026rsquo;s not coming back the same way. So appreciate it now. Appreciate the years behind you and go all in on the bet that you’ll be around for years to come. Because life is not short. Life is long. Very long. And it\u0026rsquo;s not going to be easy. Take charge of your life now before it\u0026rsquo;s too late. Do not get complacent. Do not get passive. Do not ever think you have to stay where you are, and not dare to surpass the imaginary bar set by other around you. Inspire others. You’re going to die. Don’t you want to live up to a legacy you’re proud of?\nDo stuff. Stay busy. Otherwise, what else is there to do? It\u0026rsquo;s funny how boredom exists. Everything is an abstraction. We are in a simulation. Wake up. Have gratitude. I say: Be a little schizo. Be a little delusional. It can do some good sometimes.\n11/20/2023 Almost Turkey Day # Wild Red via IG\nIs it a bit much to title my daily blog posts? I think it\u0026rsquo;s too late for me to go back now so you’re going to have to deal with it.\nThis morning I listened to “2008” by ericadoa and “Little Girl” by Dangermouse and Julian Casablancas. They were recommended by the members of Waveform in an interview. Or not recommended exactly, but they said that those were those favorite songs at that moment. Maybe for that year? Also “How to Be Kind” by Fish Hunt. They’re all great. I love hyperpop and Julian Casablancas so it was a nice surprise.\nHere is some lore. I’m from Scranton and my old roommates are too, although a different part of it. Their friend\u0026rsquo;s boyfriend Rylan, at the time I\u0026rsquo;m writing this, is the brother of a dude named Jonah, who is playing bass in the band Hot Mulligan. He is in Misery Club and has done a lot of work with Wicca Phase Springs Eternal. This is all public information I promise. Rylan and Jonah play in the band Wild Red along with the guitarist from 10 Sluggz. His name is Dan and he plays drums for them. Dan does a lot of shit actually. I met him and Jonah briefly. I talked to Dan about the music video he shot for Soul Glo. It was “Gold Chain Punk”. I want to make more music videos. I’ve known Rylan for some time actually. He introduced me to Jonah outside of Bonk’s Bar where Wild Red had a gig with a Florida band \u0026ldquo;getwiththis\u0026rdquo;. Wild Red is from a town near Wilkes-Barre which was the stomping ground of another little band I like called Title Fight. I annoyingly talked about Title Fight too much with them. I think they’re both nice guys who have a great appreciation for the craft. I thought about getting a show together back in Scranton once Hot Mulligan is done touring.\nDimmer Update:\nAt the time of writing Dimmer has 5 songs that we see as adequate to play. They are just demos, but it makes me so happy that we’ve come this far. Hopefully we can get people something they can chew on. We have a couple of other songs on the backburner that we may flush out. Songwriting has been a very interesting process and we’re still figuring it out. Thank God for Google Drive and Garageband.\nI’m going to leave my job to do dropshipping and get rich quick schemes.\n11/27/2023 Your Pain Is Mine Now #I have my first string of YouTube videos set to upload this Friday at noon. Two of them are already out there. They’re fan made music videos. The other one is called “Just Start” and it\u0026rsquo;s a shitty video. But that is the point of it. I had to get out of my own way and just start on the path to making videos.\nIn my personal life I am dealing with a lot right now. It\u0026rsquo;s very stressful. I’ve never dealt with stress like this to be honest.\nThe stress. It\u0026rsquo;s my job. Its relationships. It\u0026rsquo;s my friends. It\u0026rsquo;s my family. It\u0026rsquo;s the future. It\u0026rsquo;s the past. It\u0026rsquo;s my perception of myself. It\u0026rsquo;s being uncomfortable with the fact that nothing is promised. I hate driving cars. I listened to Floral Green today.\n11/28/203 Finding Car Seat Headrest # Everette True via everetttest\nI am so tired today in my little cubicle. I think my roommate keeps turning the heat off because he likes to sleep in the cold. I get it, it feels more snug under the blankets, but I gotta get up for work!\nI’m very excited for our show coming up. It\u0026rsquo;s at a kid’s apartment they call \u0026ldquo;the Monastery\u0026rdquo; and the Monks are opening. It’s the Monks’ apartment. They do covers of the Strokes and Arctic Monkeys. Cats on Mushrooms is also playing. I love and miss my boy Matt Perkins. A true music man he is. I would walk home and see him practicing for the drumline on Geasey field. It was right across from my apartment at the time. He was in Temple’s band. But before that he was in my Data Structures and Algorithms class. That was where we bonded and shared our love for music. He showed me Car Seat Headrest and LCD Soundsystem. Which to my knowledge are his two favorite bands of all time. I think he said he likes LCD more though. I saw Car Seat Headrest with him. It\u0026rsquo;s a funny story.\nMy junior year of college I casually threw on Twin Fantasy while doing homework. Little did I know it would make me cry. I couldn’t hold back the tears when I heard those lyrics and those choruses. Pure emotion was oozing out of the lead singer who I hadn\u0026rsquo;t investigated yet. I went in blind. I remember Bodys came on and the line came where he cries and pleads. “Don’t you realize our bodies can fall apart at any second?”. I was in love with Car Seat Headrest after that moment. Them and Black Country New Road really defined that year for me. LCD too. I was able to face pent up emotions more and more. That was also the time where Mike started expanding my world of music as well.\nI could write an essay on Car Seat Headrest. It\u0026rsquo;s very good and very gay. This band came into my life at the perfect time when I needed those words and those emotions. I don’t know if it\u0026rsquo;s a gay thing, but there is something about the emotions Will displays that feel ethereal. (Isaac Wood\u0026rsquo;s as well.) I get it. I felt less alone. I felt like my feelings were being articulated in their music with a real precision and perfection I had yet to discover. It was so utterly raw, and I realized that being honest with yourself and your emotions, expressing them in magical ways, letting go of ego, doing what you want, was more badass than acting like your some tought emotionaless zombie. I hope that makes sense.\nI realized that I highly valued people who did what they liked no matter what others think. Expressing yourself is the way to be. I broke my old mindset. I used to think that a drag show queen was obviously less masculine than a UFC fighter. Something else outside of me made me think that. But those lines are far blurrier than anyone thinks. Any time spent worrying about if you look too feminine or too masculine is an absolute waste. Look up Diego Garijo. There’s no rules. You’re not what people view you as, you’re what you know you are. Just be yourself. Define yourself for yourself.\nWill Toledo did not hold back. It made me realize that I was. And I need to start really trying to stop that.\nI didn’t buy a ticket to see Car Seat Headrest because I knew the universe would make me see them. And it did. Matt miraculously had an extra ticket the day or so before the show and we went. That’s where I met Merr too. Right now they are the drummer for the Vatican City Missile Crisis. I think we\u0026rsquo;ll all go on to do cool stuff.\n","date":"1 November 2023","permalink":"/blog/2023/november-backlogs/","section":"Blogs","summary":"All my November blogs rolled into one.

Right now I’m writing on a Google doc. I don’t have a place where I’m hosting and sharing this blog for all to see yet, but I will soon. One would think I would have thought about starting a blog for a long time, but it\u0026rsquo;s actually quite the contrary. So far, a blog has been a fleeting idea in my life, however I have a lot of confidence that this will be great for me, and I’ll remain consistent. While I go crazy here at my office job, I decided I\u0026rsquo;m sure as hell going to document it.\nFor a while I\u0026rsquo;ve been journaling for therapeutic purposes. I have entire books. It helps me, and I bet it would help you. (If you don\u0026rsquo;t do it already.) I won’t get into the psychology of it. The only difference now is that it\u0026rsquo;s for the public to see.\nI want to be authentic and personable here because I don’t think enough people are. I think it\u0026rsquo;s time for my writing to be shared with the world. It\u0026rsquo;s one of the greatest gifts we have as humans.\nThere are a lot of people I look up to who are just everyday people. People in my life. Being with them gives me the same feeling I think I’d get if I’m ever hanging with one of my idols who are world reknown. I get very curious about their thoughts, their daily life, what they think about, etc. Mostly in the context of how they go about creating their their craft, whatever it may be. I just want to pick their brain over and over and over again. I’ve been obsessed with interviews and sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s hard to find stuff like that. So maybe I can start a trend. Everybody blogs. Maybe my brain will be the one someone wants to pick one day? (If they’re the right kind of crazy.) And then they’ll have this. Regardless, I’m doing this for myself to a degree. Its for myself and the reader, but I will be unapologetically talking about my life and all the stuff I’m nerdy about.\nI have way too many thoughts that my body gets upset about. I think I can alleviate this symptom by getting thoughts on paper and screens. Curiosities finally shared. That’s what I realized being an artist and a musician is about for myself. It conveys those thoughts and feelings in a way that isn’t boring. In a way where someone can understand it more than words can say. Simply put, it just works. It just feels better to express. So sorry if you don’t like how I express myself. Or if it makes you uncomfortable. I guess maybe I’m doing it for selfish reasons.\nWords still say a lot though. They\u0026rsquo;re a powerful medium of expression. I mean I’d argue that the invention of language is the biggest reason we conquered nature and got to where we are now as a species.\nI’m so damn excited for this blog. I can already feel that it\u0026rsquo;s been 2Long. We’re going to get INTO IT here. Philadelphia is my kryptonite in a good way.\n10/30/2023 Noise # Mitchell Jorstad via X (Twitter)\nIn my office at my desk there is this terrible noise ringing above my head from the rumbling of the central air system. It\u0026rsquo;s very annoying, and not exciting to read about I’m sure, but I figured Nardwaur could ask me about it one day. And I’ll say, “yeah, that was annoying”.\nThoughts like these make me realize that I really am crazy enough to envision a future like that where I’m living a dream. I’m actually crazy enough to think I can achieve my dreams. However I often ask myself, “what else is there to do?”. I imagine one day I’ll find the right person, or people, and I’ll settle down somewhere. Somewhere pretty and quiet and I’ll just exist. It’ll be like changing from survival to peaceful mode. Hopefully I figure out how I can make money online, or all corporations just finally let us work from home. Whatever works, as long as it works. I’m so completely sick of the hustling and bustling of the eastern seaboard. The highways, and fast food, and office buildings, and industrial parks, and more. I am so sick of it. I can see why it\u0026rsquo;s an economic powerhouse of the modern world. It\u0026rsquo;s a machine that doesn’t stop running. It runs on human lives. It won’t have mine.\nI think becoming comfortable too early in life is what dooms most.\n10/31/2023 Adventure Time # (Me at at Chapter House on Halloween, Mikey baby got sick. People kept going in Ben\u0026rsquo;s room so he was using scotch tape to keep it shut.)\nI am dressed up as Finn from Adventure Time today for our company’s costume contest. My two friends here are Marceline and PB respectively.\nRight now I feel pretty trapped in this job. I don’t feel like I have as much going for me as I would like to. All I know is it\u0026rsquo;s good to save money right now. By now I wanted to finish the documentary for the Philly Stoop. I wanted to have my personal website up. I wanted my song “Kenopsia” and accompanying music video to be out. I finished editing a YouTube video though. And I guess starting this blog is progress too. I need better internet in my house goddammit. I need that ethernet outlet dawg. Like please, I’m begging you. My PC can’t handle shitty Wi-Fi. I should just buy a Mac.\nWhen I get home I need to rest because I will NOT miss Julie at the Ukie Club. I am coming down with a cold atm and I’m not too pleased about it. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s because I’ve been going to the gym too much. I doubt they clean those machines thoroughly. It\u0026rsquo;s nothing but water and sleep when I get home. Tunaween is tonight with Friend and Wallace, Tonight! and Disaster Artist. I don’t think I’m going to make it. I’m going to take some extra strength cold and flu or whatever big pharma nonsense will help me.\nJulie is a band that I look up to a lot. I\u0026rsquo;m inspired by them with my art and music in so many ways. They are probably in my top 5 modern bands right now. Class acts in whatever the hell you want to group them as. I think they’re aggressive but soft. They’re visceral and aesthetic. They definitely nailed their aesthetic. I love them. I’ll shut up now.\nMaybe I’m not as good at blogging as I think I am? Isn\u0026rsquo;t this just a diary or what?\n","date":"26 October 2023","permalink":"/blog/2023/october-backlogs/","section":"Blogs","summary":"All of my October backlogs.
