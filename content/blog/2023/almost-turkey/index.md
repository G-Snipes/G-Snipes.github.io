Is it a bit much to title my daily blog posts? I think it's too late for me to go back now so you’re going to have to deal with it. I’ll probably blog more when I have more time. 

This morning I listened to “2008” by ericadoa and “Little Girl” by Dangermouse and Julian Casablancas. They were recommended by the members of Waveform in an interview. Or not recommended exactly, but they said that those were those favorite songs at that moment. Maybe for that year? I’m not sure, I just wrote those songs down on sticky notes 2 weeks ago. Also “How to Be Kind” by Fish Hunt. They’re all great. I love hyperpop and Julian Casablancas so it was a nice surprise. 

Here is some lore. I’m from Scranton and my old roommates are too although a different part of it. Their friend from highschool at the time I’m writing this is dating a dude named Rylan, who is the brother of a dude named Jonah, who is playing bass in the band Hot Mulligan. This is all public information I swear. They’re in the pop punk niche. They play in the band Wild Red along with the guitarist from 10 Sluggz. His name is Dan and he plays drums for them. I don’t know how they practice because they live 2 hours away from each other, but anyways I met him and Jonah briefly. I talked to Dan about the music video he shot for Soul Glo, it was “Gold Chain Punk”. I want to make more music videos. I’ve known Rylan for some time actually. He introduced me to Jonah outside of Bonk’s Bar where Wild Red had a gig with Florida band getwiththis. They’re from Wilkes-Barre which was the stomping ground of another little band I like called Title Fight. I annoyingly talked about Title Fight too much. They’re both great guys who have a huge appreciation for the craft. I thought about getting a show together back in Scranton once Hot Mulligan is done touring. 
### Dimmer Update
At the time of writing Dimmer has 5 songs that we see as adequate to play. They are all demos, and demos are demos, but I mean it just makes me so happy that we’ve come this far. I think we’re going to record all the songs live and throw it up on Soundcloud as demos so the fans finally have something they can chew on. We have a couple of other songs on the backburner that we may flush out. Songwriting has been a very interesting process and we’re still figuring it out. Thank God for Google Drive and Garageband. 

I’m going to leave my job to do dropshipping and get rich quick schemes.
