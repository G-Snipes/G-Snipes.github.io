Well my bandmates are inspired after seeing Julie last night. Myself included. Talk about a phenomenal upcoming band. Great original sound, original aesthetic, and cool people. I stayed late after the show. Not on purpose, I got caught up talking to some homies outside the venue. I met the band. I talked to them a bit. Tried to get their Spotifys to stalk. I didn’t get them then and there, but I found them later. Alex signed my guitar pick. Thank you! They told me they use the same pick for bass. My pick is somewhat thick for a guitarist. I got a medium thick and sturdy pick after hearing advice from my metal guitarist friend JD. I always prefer medium/thin and sturdy now. 


I can’t wait to cook. 

Something funny and something I still don't know how to deal with regarding the underground scene is that my favorite bands, my favorite artists, are often standing next to me in the crowd. Standing side by side at the urinals. They’re at the same show as me. It sounds stupid, I know they’re just people like me, but sometimes I can’t help but celebritize them. It’s something I’m working on. I try my absolute hardest to stay calm and talk to them like I met them on the street. Because that’s how people should be treated of course, how any new person should be treated. On a normal interaction I’m kind, courteous, and curious to people I meet for the first time. With these underground artists I sometimes struggle not to be an absolute fanboy and act standoffish. I got some growing up to do…

When you’re so deep into an artistic medium you develop an appreciation for new artists in the scene that you find and like. And you can become obsessive. In a way, a lot of the time, it's almost like the art is personified in the human being that made it. Talking to the musician who made a song is like talking to the song itself. You’re talking to its conjurer. We’re all little Gods whenever we create stuff, and it’s fucking cool. 

Talking to the members of Julie I think, “It's so late, they’re touring, hauling all their equipment to put away, probably trying to get out of the venue asap so they can get some sleep before the highway wakes them up.” I assume that. I could probably ask,  “Hey I’m a big fan and I know it's late, could you chat for a few minutes?” Then it's on them if they decide to talk to me. But those rational thoughts have yet to stay present in those moments. Am I being rational? Or am I just not being confident? Am I forcing my presence on someone, or is this exactly how a friendship should start? You have to be careful with that word “should”. 


I’ve absorbed so much music and talked to so many artists. I figure, let them come to me.

I would really like to talk to Tyler, the Creator one day. But at this point in my life I don’t think it would be right if I did? That’s like selling out Wells Fargo when you only wrote one song with only two notes in it. It doesn’t feel right. He is a walking goat, what do I have to show for it? I need a history of music, music videos, and/or other art to show for myself. Look, I don’t like that I gate keep myself. No one ever should. I think the point I was getting to is that if you want to talk to your idols make yourself feel certain that they would want to talk to you.
