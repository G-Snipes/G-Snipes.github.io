You ever get so stressed and worried that it physically hurts. Your brain can’t even think straight. You can’t even find a rational solution. You figure out how you’re going to deal with your problems, but your conscience still wants to worry. You tell yourself like “Okay, when the time comes we’re going to do this.” And then it's settled, it's done. You decided what you’re going to do; what the best thing to do is. But still, your mind and body don't have it. It's still on alert. It is still stressed. You’re in panic mode. Just waiting for time to pass when the stress will inevitably go away. 

I’m going back to therapy. I really need it atm. I decided it was time before this stress after I had yet another existential crisis brought on by vacation. Sometimes I feel this world isn’t made for us. 

Something that’s been messing with me lately is how we all just “think” we are alive. We think we're special and things are things but they’re not. Everything we see we just name. We’re just assigning specific sounds to things. All the parts of our anatomy aren’t actually what we call them. That’s not their name. We named them, and we’re not real. We just think we are. Am I making sense? Maybe not, it's tricky to convey.


How do we know this is the highest reality? Isn’t everything just an abstraction? Maybe we’re simulated. I think there is a lot of evidence to support that. Maybe God is trying to run simulations in the hopes of making another God to hang out with. I’m glad our bodies are resilient, for most of us… Like Mr. Peanutbutter said, “The universe is a cruel uncaring void.”
