I have my first string of YouTube videos set to upload this Friday at noon. Two of them are already out there. They’re fan made music videos. The other one is called “Just Start” and it's a shitty video. But that is the point of it. I had to get out of my own way and just start on the path to making videos. And over time I will get better and better at them and their quality will keep getting better. 

In my personal life I am dealing with a lot right now. It's very stressful. I’ve never dealt with stress like this to be honest. I can only describe the feeling as this, “knowing I have to fire someone and I have to do it soon”. All this stuff I can’t worry about because I have to practice! Our gig is literally this Saturday.

The stress. It's my job. Its relationships. It's my friends. It's my family. It's the future. It's the past. It's my perception of myself. It's being uncomfortable with the fact that nothing is promised. I hate driving cars. I listened to Floral Green today.
