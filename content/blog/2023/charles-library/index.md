Working in the Charles Library because I’m trying to remember what it's like to be a college student. Just kidding… but walking around campus is bittersweet. It's crazy how much of a different person I am with a different mindset compared to last May when I was graduating. A lot can happen in a year. 

I thought that once I got out of college I would have no more excuses for myself. At that point it's just me vs. myself. Nothing is going to get in the way of what I want to do. In school the stress of grades and assignments meant it didn’t matter that I had more free time. I had so much free time. And so many times I’d be tired and unproductive. Stress and anxiety and all that jazz. 

Cleaning up my computer and iPhone right now. Doing that once in a while clears your head. It just does. I think it's always good to clean before doing a more mentally exhaustive task. It’s like warming up for sports. We’re working on the demos later. I have to finish up the Stoop documentary and my personal website. I might work at the Met.
