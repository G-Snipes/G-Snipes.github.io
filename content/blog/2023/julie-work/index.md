Maybe tomorrow’s title should be called “Julie”. Because I’m seeing them tonight, so won’t I have more to say on the show until tomorrow. Shit is this blog boring af? 

I’m not feeling work today at all. Transitioning from “new employee” work to “actual” work sucks for me because I’m too used to the new employee work. Getting my hand held. Having a lot of time. Having the work be easy. You feel like you need to do more. Your managers act as a panopticon making you wonder if they're going to walk by and see you not doing work. Or see you not at your desk. Or seeing you write a blog complaining about work. 

This job has scared me straight. I try to take my time here as a lesson to hustle when I don’t work here anymore so I never have to work in a place like this again. I’m the only one of my friends who has a salaried job with benefits out of school. I don’t realize how good I have it. I feel sick today and don’t have enough PTO to take off work. But they don’t even know what PTO is. In a figurative sense of course. I have so much free time to learn new things. I pretty much taught myself guitar theory while working here. It does pay me well. Hopefully I’ll be able to pay off my loans sooner than I thought. There are good restaurants around for lunch. Commuting is manageable. I have some former colleagues here. I made some friends here who I see everyday. None of my coworkers are bad. Work is easy. And yet…

I want out. I feel lied to and betrayed by the system. All this extra time and work and energy into school for 16 years for me to land a random job. Did I want this? Was this the light at the end of the tunnel? What else did I think would happen? I remember wanting a computer science degree so I can land a job and have enough time and money to do my hobbies on the side. And that’s basically what I have now. I wanted to travel more but with my soul glued to the area’s underground music scene I won’t be leaving anytime soon. 

The thing that gets me is something I put a higher price on everyday. And that is my time. 

Work takes my time. 

It takes it right away from my feeble little body navigating this reality. 

Existential dread comes out of nowhere some days to push me to the ground and kick in my ribs. Make my heart ache. Make my anxiety skyrocket. Where was the class in school that addressed this daily problem? Oh, is it therapy? It's just the fact that I don’t think my job does ANYTHING for the betterment of society and humanity as a whole. 

I could have hunted, killed, and dragged a deer back to the village so all my loved ones get to eat. I don’t even get a glimpse of the feelings I’d imagine that hunter persona of me would have. My job, that I do everyday, feels completely pointless. And feeling that on a daily basis sucks.
