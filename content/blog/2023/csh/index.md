I am so tired today in my little cubicle. I think my roommate keeps turning the heat off because he likes to sleep in the cold. I get it, it feels more snug, but I gotta get up for work!

I’m very excited for our show coming up, it should go over very well. It's at a kid’s apartment called the Monastery and the Monks are opening. It’s the Monks’ apartment. They do covers of the Strokes and Arctic Monkeys. Cats on Mushrooms is also playing. I love and miss my boy Matt Perkins. A true music man he is. I would walk home and see him practicing for the drumline on Geasey field. It was right across from my apartment at the time. He was in Temple’s band. But before that he was in my Data Structures and Algorithms class. That was where we bonded and shared our love for music. He would also laugh at me because I would accidentally touch his laptop screen and be amazed that it’s a touch screen. (He laughed because it happened like 6 times.) He showed me Car Seat Headrest and LCD Soundsystem. Which to my knowledge are his two favorite bands of all time. I think he likes LCD more though. I saw Car Seat Headrest with him. It's a funny story.

My junior year of college I threw on Twin Fantasy while doing homework. Little did I know it would make me cry. I couldn’t hold back the tears when I heard those lyrics and those choruses. Pure emotion was oozing out of the lead singer who I didn’t even investigate yet. I remember Bodys came on and the line came where he cries and pleads. “Don’t you realize our bodies can fall apart at any second?”. I was in love with Car Seat Headrest after that moment. Them and Black Country New Road really defined that year for me. LCD too. I was able to face pent up emotions more and more. That was also the time where Mike started expanding my world of music as well. 

I could write an essay on Car Seat Headrest. It's very good and very gay. This band came into my life at the perfect time when I needed those words and those emotions. I don’t know if it's a gay thing (I don’t consider myself to be straight), but there is something about the emotions Will displays that feel ethereal. I get it. I felt less alone. I felt like my feelings were being articulated in their music with a real perfection I had yet to discover. It was so utterly raw, and I realized that being honest with yourself and your emotions, expressing them in magical ways, letting go of ego, doing what you want, was more badass than acting like your some masculine blue-pilled zombie. I hope that makes sense. 

I realized that I highly valued people who did what they liked no matter what others think. Expressing yourself is the way to be. I broke my old mindset. I used to think that a drag show queen was obviously less masculine than a UFC fighter. Someone else made me think that. Any time spent worrying about if you look too feminine or too masculine is an absolute waste. Look up Diego Garijo, there’s no rules. You’re not what people view you as, you’re what you know you are. Just be yourself. Define yourself for yourself.

Will Toledo did not hold back. It made me realize that I was. And I need to start really trying to stop that. 

I didn’t buy a ticket to see Car Seat Headrest because I knew the universe would make me see them. And it did. Matt miraculously had an extra ticket the day or so before the show and we went. That’s where I met Merr too. Right now they are the drummer for the Vatican City Missile Crisis. I think we'll all go far.
