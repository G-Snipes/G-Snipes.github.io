“Memento Mori” is a latin phrase that I really live by. It means “remember you will die”. It sounds morbid at first. I found it because it was the slogan of the Austere Academy that the Baudelaire children stay at in the 5th book of Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events. What else would it be with an author like Snicket?

You’re going to die. I always say death is the most neutral thing possible. “Oh no, there’s nothing after death!” Who told you that "nothing" is bad? Nothing is nothing. It is perfectly gray. That’s not the point. I think for most of my life, I spent it not realizing that everything I see is made up. Not that reality isn’t real, but that everything we have isn’t a given. We don’t stop to contemplate about how much of our abilities aren’t a given. It feels like language is a given. It feels like food and water and shelter is a given. Often times our friends and health. I know it's not the same for everyone, some people are dealt a bad hand that introduces them to reality at a young age, but some people go through their whole life completely blue-pilled.

Not realizing that everything is a construct is bad for business. In a spiritual sense. Do you realize that all the math ever made can be chalked up to some wierd drawings. Or that language can just be called “specific noises”. Everything we experience in our head is stored in our biological computer. That’s where the world actually is in a sense. I’m sure you’ve heard a lot of this before. This wasn’t even the rant I thought I’d go on about with “memento mori”, but its important to remember.

Motivational speech time. Make sure to buy my course after this. 

Listen, you have one life. One body. If you lose an arm, it's gone forever. Or at least it's not coming back the same way. So appreciate it now. Appreciate the years behind you and go all in on the bet that you’ll be around for years to come. Because life is not short. Life is long. Very long. And it's not going to be easy. Take charge of your life now before it's too late. Do not get complacent. Do not get passive. Do not ever think you have to stay where you are, and not surpass the bar set by the tribe around you. Inspire others. You’re going to die. Don’t you want to live up to a legacy you’re proud of?

Do stuff. Stay busy. Otherwise, what else is there to do? It's funny how boredom exists. Everything is an abstraction. We are in a simulation. Wake up. Be a little schizo. Be a little delusional. It can do some good sometimes.
