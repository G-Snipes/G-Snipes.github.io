I am dressed up as Finn from Adventure Time today for our company’s costume contest. My two friends here are Marceline and PB respectively. 

Right now I feel pretty trapped in this job. I don’t feel like I have as much going for me as I would like to. All I know is it's good to save money right now. By now I wanted to finish the documentary for the Philadelphia Stoop venue. I wanted to have my personal website up. I wanted my personal song “Kenopsia” and accompanying music video to be out for it. I still haven’t gotten access to Adobe creative cloud. I’m going to ask one of my friends who still goes to Temple to let me use their account since it's $100. At this point maybe I should just give into the annual subscription if I’m going to be all in anyway. I finished editing a YouTube video though. And I guess starting this blog is progress too. I need better internet in my house goddammit. I need that ethernet outlet dawg. Like please, I’m begging you. My PC can’t handle shitty Wi-Fi. I should just buy a Mac. 

When I get home I need to rest because I will NOT miss Julie at the Ukie Club. I am coming down with a cold atm and I’m not too pleased about it. Maybe it's because I’ve been going to the gym too much. I doubt they clean those machines thoroughly. Fuck I cannot miss that show. I just simply refuse to. It's nothing but water and sleep when I get home. Tunaween is tonight with Friend and Wallace, Tonight and Disaster Artist. I don’t think I’m going to make it. I’m going to take some extra strength cold and flu or whatever the hell big pharma nonsense that will help me.  

But yeah Julie is a band that means a lot to me. I aspire to be like them with my art and music in so many ways. They are probably in my top 10 bands right now. Class acts in whatever the hell you want to group them as. I think they’re aggressive but soft. They’re visceral and aesthetic. They definitely nailed their aesthetic. Maybe I’ll work with them one day. I love them. But until then I’ll shut up.  

Maybe I’m not as good at blogging as I think I am.
