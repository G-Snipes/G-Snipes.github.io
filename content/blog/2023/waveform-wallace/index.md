Holy crap! Should I curse here? I’m going to omit profanity from this blog. Anyways I love Waveform holy crap they’re so good. Just go listen. The articles I’ve read have articulated very well the emotions their music invokes, but I am also being lazy at the moment. They’re signed to Run For Cover Records. I love so many of the other artists/bands signed to that label. Horse Jumper of Love, Turnover, Wicca Phase Springs Eternal… I’d love for us to sign to a label with an ethos like Run for Cover one day, but until then we’re independent as fuck. I think my bandmates would love to sign to Juliaswar, who I’m not opposed to either. I’m getting ahead of myself though. We got to release music first lmao.

### Dimmer stuff
Jeff was thinking of some Soundcloud snippets. This way people can hear what we sound like. Other than that I don’t think we should release music for a while. We have 4 songs pretty much done at the moment that we like. Two other ones that are also done but we don’t like. We have a song in 6/8 time that Jeff isn’t feeling. I love it though because I think my vocals shine, and it is rhythmically different for obvious reasons. Our band functions as a democracy best it can. So there you have it. Our secret is out. We are a democratic band. 

### Book?
Maybe I really should start writing a book. I have so much I want to talk about. I know it's cringe to care about stuff but bear with me oh wise Buddha. Maybe I shouldn’t talk about stuff because if I get it all out of me in words, I won’t want to get it out of me so much in music anymore. That last sentence was a joke. People on the internet are often bad with humor and sarcasm. I think sometimes they’re crazy, and sometimes stuff gets lost in translation. I used to think emojis were cringey for a long time but the fact is they’re super helpful. Our expressions and tones when we talk, all the little subtleties can change the context of something that is said. Like how now you think I’m yelling right now! Wow, I’m such a David Foster Wallace genius over here talking about punctuation and being emotive in conversations! 

### Wallace, Tonight
Fear and Loathing with Wallace this Friday! John sent me more Wallace Tonight recordings and demos. They are so good. They are all masterful at what they do. I love Paul’s vocals a lot. Am I supposed to have been given those demos? Guys if you see this, don’t get mad at John. I won’t share it with anyone. The last of the three EPs is probably out by the time you’re reading this anyways.
