Okay bear with me and let me get some stuff out of the way. Right now I’m writing on a Google doc. I don’t have a place where I’m hosting and sharing this blog for all to see yet, but I will soon. You would think I would have thought about starting a blog for a long time, but it's actually quite the contrary. So far, a blog has been a fleeting idea in my life, however I have a lot of confidence that this will be great for me, and I’ll remain consistent. I already consistently journal everyday with paper and pencil, although that does come in phases. I started getting very consistent with it because I have a lot of time at my current office job and if I was going to go crazy working here I was sure as hell going to document it.

Before that I was journaling most nights for therapeutic purposes. Months and months and months. I have entire books. It helps me, and I bet it would help you if you don’t already. I won’t get into the psychology of it. The only difference now is that it's for the public to see. Am I going to omit certain things since this is public? Probably… however, I’m going to try my best to not do that. Besides the obvious like the numbers on the back of my credit cards. 

I want to be authentic and personable here because I don’t think enough people are. I think it's time for my writing to be shared with the world. It's one of the greatest gifts we have as humans. That being said, I might usually keep the names of people in these blogs private if they are someone who is in my personal life. In other words I might talk about friends or family and the things surrounding them, but not explicitly say who they are. 

There are a lot of people I look up to who are just everyday people. People in my life. Being with them gives me the same feeling I think I’d get if I’m ever hanging with one of my idols who are very famous and successful. I get very curious about their thoughts, their daily life, what they think about, etc. Mostly in the context of how they go about creating their music and art. I just want to pick their brain over and over and over again. I’ve been obsessed with interviews and sometimes it's hard to find stuff like that. So maybe I can start a trend. Everybody blogs Maybe my brain will be the one someone wants to pick one day? If they’re crazy enough. And then they’ll have this. Regardless I’m doing this for myself, and I’m going to talk about all the stuff I’m nerdy about and life in general. 

I have way too many thoughts that my body gets upset about. I think I can alleviate this symptom by getting thoughts on paper and screens. That’s what I realized being an artist and a musician is about for myself. It conveys those thoughts and feelings in a way that isn’t boring. In a way where someone can understand it more than words can say. Simply put, it just works. It just feels better to express. So sorry if you don’t like how I express myself. Or if it makes you uncomfortable. I guess maybe I’m doing it for selfish reasons.

Words still say a lot. Words are just one medium of expression, and can do a lot. I mean I’d argue that the invention of language is the biggest reason we defeated nature and got to where we are now as a species. But there is far more than language.

I’m so damn excited for this blog. I can already feel that it's been 2Long. We’re going to get INTO IT here. Philadelphia is my kryptonite in a good way.
