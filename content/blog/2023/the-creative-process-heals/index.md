I always have so much to say. Starting this blog has made me realize how much I have to say, and how I can effectively talk to myself. Writing out your thoughts will reveal all to you. Everything in your mind put onto paper is indisputable. 

I had a talk with my friend Joycie last night about life and creativity. I wish I could see him more. We both work a lot, usually opposite schedules. I could write a novel about my beautiful friendship with him that has lasted since kindergarten when I was jealous of the clear tray he had in class. (Most of the students in the class had a black tray, for papers and whatnot, but he had a clear one.) Now, 16 years later, we are best friends. He lets my band practice in his basement. I’ll gas him up more probably another time. 

Anyways we talked about how the creative process evolves and heals you as a person. How being an artist is therapeutic. I don’t know the psychology as to why creation is healing, it just is. We talked about Tyler, the Creator and Action Bronson and Dave Grohl and what they all have in common. A couple things I’ll list below:

  - They have started unapologetically doing what they want and liking what they like from a young age.
  - They are passionate about everything in every moment, not just about the mediums they’ve found success in. 
  - They are grateful for life. 
  - They are completely themselves all the time. 
  - They have a large support system around them. 
  - They have great relationships with their mothers, and the women in their life. 

Joycie praised and showed gratitude for all the women in his life. I’m glad I’m going home to see my mom today. 


### Later thoughts…

I had some things to say about High School when I finished this blog post. Probably because it relates to the rest. Now that college is finished, High School seems even more like a dream. I have very strange reactions when I think of some high school memories. I think it comes from over romanticizing it, nostalgia, pain, and feeling like it was another life. Because it kind of was for me, even though it sound dramatic. 

It's just so surreal sometimes.
