In my office at my desk there is this terrible noise ringing above my head from the rumbling of the central air system. It's very annoying, and not exciting to hear about I’m sure, but I figured Nardwaur could ask me about it one day. And I’ll say, “yeah, that was annoying”.

Thoughts like these make me realize that I really am crazy enough to envision a future like that where I’m living my dreams. Or what I mean is I’m crazy enough to think I can achieve them. I often ask myself, “what else is there to do?”. I imagine one day I’ll find the right person, or people, and I’ll settle down somewhere. Somewhere pretty and quiet and I’ll just exist. It’ll be like changing from survival to peaceful mode. Hopefully I figure out how I can make money online, or most corporations just finally let us work from home. Whatever works, as long as it works. I’m so completely sick of the hustling and bustling of the eastern seaboard. The highways, and fast food, and office buildings, and industrial parks, and more I am so sick of. I can see why it's an economic powerhouse of the modern world. It's a machine that doesn’t stop running and it runs on human lives. It won’t have mine. 

Do I need to relax? Maybe. But I think becoming relaxed too early is what dooms most.
