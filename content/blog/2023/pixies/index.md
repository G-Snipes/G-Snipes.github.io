I’ve been listening to Doolittle. That album is divine. It’s like candy to my music mind. It's so emotional and fun. It just is. Very inspiring. I’d love to sound like Black Francis. The songs are so layered and deep that I’m not getting sick of them. They have such a November vibe.

Dimmer is trying to get our shit together so we can have new songs ready for the show December 2nd with the Monks. Or at least that’s what’s getting set up right now. Our friend Matt Perkins will hopefully play with us in his band “Cats on Mushrooms”. Name never gets old. I’m dying to play a show off campus at Temple. It's a big reason I stuck around the university. Much to my dad’s objections. 

I don’t know how to lower my expectations of life right now. I have big dreams and I’m trying to achieve them. I’m trying to find an alternative to the job I have. But will I miss the present moment too much trying to pursue this creative and financial freedom? Escaping the matrix doesn’t exactly mean financial freedom to me. Although I’m not saying that wouldn’t help. Escaping the matrix is just enjoying your life and having enough time to pursue your hobbies. Enough time that you’re satisfied with. Maybe I’m still just desperate to feel special, before this monkey’s gone to heaven. 

I want to convey all these weird and magical and strange and complex feelings I’ve had throughout my life. I don’t want to feel alone, I don’t want others to be too. I want to relate. A lot of these feelings contain a lot of weight of existence, and they probably arise from the times I felt like I was the actual center of the universe. It's powerful. The desire to express yourself becomes overwhelming because you realize you can go at any moment. At least that’s what I think.
