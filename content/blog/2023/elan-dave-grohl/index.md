I made a resume today. For a security position at a local venue. If I get hired I get to just stand there and hear live music for free. And I get paid to do it!? Sounds like a win win to me. My friend Joycie works at the Mann center. He swears on it being the best job of all time, or one of them. Experiences are priceless. They’re moments in time that you’re paying for. You’re paying to be present at a certain spot in space and time? I’d kill to work at music venues with the salary I do now. I don’t think that will ever happen though. I guess I’ll keep you posted. If you’re reading this… Why are you reading this? 

### Elan School 

I finished elan school. [Elan.school](https://elan.school/) is a masterpiece, but I don’t think it's right to call it that. Not that it isn’t a “masterpiece”, it's a story the creator never asked for. At least at the start. He wasn’t making this webcomic, graphic novel based on a fictional character that he feeds his own experience into. This was his experience. It's an autobiography. And it just so happens to be one of the most incredible stories I’ve ever heard. It's real. Do you know what that means? It's weird to feel like you know someone so intimately, yet never meeting them. In Joe Nobody’s case (the creator of elan.school), I’ve never even seen his face. If I ever saw him though I think I’d actually break down and sob. And I don’t think he’d even be weirded out by it. I think he’d get it. If I’m not making sense I don’t blame you. I’m not going to attempt to describe the story. Just go read it. I will be worth your time. It will inspire you, and I think that’s something the creator would love to provide. 

### Dave Grohl

The only other person I feel like I have that deep connection with despite never meeting them is Dave Grohl. I was already fond of his music, but after reading his biography, The Storyteller, I realized I made a friend. This dude is someone who rocks, and I know that I will meet him one day. The universe has let me know, trust me. Don’t judge a book by its cover though, right? They say , “Don’t meet your idols”. Well in this case I read the book. He is the only person who I’ve taken a liking to their music and read their autobiography. Only exception is Will Smith. I read his autobiography right before the infamous slap which was so surreal to me. Anyways Dave Grohl deserves all the hype for being true to himself and being genuine. He’s the biggest rockstar to me, even if he’s not topping the charts all the time. Even though he still is haha.

Alex G’s album DSU  is becoming my favorite album of his.
